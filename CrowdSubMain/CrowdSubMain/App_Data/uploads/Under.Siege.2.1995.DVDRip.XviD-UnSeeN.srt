1
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,872
Tom, glad to see you made it.

2
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,837
I wouldn't miss it.

3
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,754
<i>National Weather Institute,</i>
<i>this is NASA Command.</i>

4
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,832
<i>Transferring control of satellite Gulf-001...</i>

5
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,269
<i>... in six...</i>

6
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,191
<i>... five... four...</i>

7
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,873
Do source code.

8
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,790
Enter current access code.
Captains Trilling, Gilder...

9
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,516
We got it. It's ours.

10
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,549
Be advised...

11
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,269
...we have received satellite Gulf-001.
Thank you, Houston.

12
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,359
All right, let's see what she can do.

13
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,268
Activating observation function.

14
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,230
Setting for Stage 2.

15
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,271
What have we got here?

16
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,271
Clean it up.

17
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,471
Oh, my God, she's turning over!

18
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,909
Apply full-image enhancing.

19
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,594
Holy guacamole!

20
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,431
The damn thing works.

21
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,231
That goddamn Travis Dane.

22
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,832
If the optical circuits are this good,
the targeting system must be great.

23
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,718
Dane would love this.

24
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,918
NASA thinks this is a weather satellite.

25
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,956
Let's do a weapons check.

26
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,794
This wasn't the bust
Congress thought it was.

27
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,678
What Congress doesn't know
won't hurt them, or us.

28
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,632
Something wrong, Captain?

29
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,995
It's too bad Dane wasn't here today.

30
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,276
Travis Dane was a nut.

31
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,550
He drove his car into a lake.

32
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,074
He was crazy.

33
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,195
They find the body yet?

34
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,191
No, just the car.

35
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,393
And a note that said:
"Chance favors the prepared mind."

36
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,708
Odd, huh?

37
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,595
But then, so was Dane.

38
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,436
Captains, you did a hell of a job.

39
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,437
Be proud of yourselves.

40
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,954
Enjoy your weekend.

41
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,393
Thank you, General.

42
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,516
Can I talk to you? Excuse me.

43
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,279
Have a nice weekend.

44
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,358
Go home.

45
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,196
There's an air show
at the Air Force Academy this weekend.

46
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,114
Maybe you'd like to join me for a drink?

47
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,270
Check out the new technologies.

48
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,833
All the top brass will be there.
Who knows...

49
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,157
...it might help your career.

50
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,637
Sorry, I have plans.

51
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,151
Yeah, sure, I understand.

52
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,390
Like the General said...

53
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,637
...you did a good job.

54
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,028
Thank you...

55
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,788
...sir.

56
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,428
Let's go, you're running late.

57
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,473
Where have you been?

58
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,912
On a special op?

59
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,278
Lieutenant, always a pleasure.

60
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,396
I know, you can't tell me.

61
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,516
Sorry to hear about your brother.

62
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,272
Me, too.

63
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,194
We must hurry to make that train.
It leaves in 45 minutes.

64
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,035
Why are you two taking a train
to California?

65
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,429
Would you fly if your parents died
in a plane crash?

66
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,919
Hi, Casey.

67
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,075
This place runs better when you're here.
I can run it, but...

68
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,639
You can't cook.

69
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,275
The patrons come here for you, Casey,
not for me.

70
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,113
She's a cute kid.

71
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,591
- Is that your niece?
- Yes. She's the only family I have left.

72
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,390
I don't know if I'll recognize her.

73
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,870
Come on, we'll miss that train.

74
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,755
I missed my brother's funeral, so...

75
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,678
...we won't miss the train.

76
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,357
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

77
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,719
<i>The Grand Continental Service from Denver</i>
<i>to Los Angeles, now boarding.</i>

78
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,878
Has a Sarah Ryback picked up any tickets?

79
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,792
Uncle Casey.

80
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,158
Nice to see you, too.

81
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,233
You've gotten big.

82
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,390
A lot can happen in five years.

83
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,433
Just a moment.

84
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,160
So, what have you been doing?

85
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,756
Taking care of airplane crashes,
funerals, stuff like that.

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,911
Yeah, so...

87
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,111
Here you are. Track 3.

88
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,711
You know, I was thinking...

89
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,670
I remembered that you collect teddy bears
and I got you one.

90
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,076
It isn't as good as some of yours...

91
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,715
...and I know you may be too mature...

92
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,195
...to hang out with teddy bears now.

93
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,950
It's the thought that counts.

94
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,115
Thanks.

95
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,114
I guess I'm not trained for this.

96
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,839
Excuse me.

97
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,399
Can I carry your bags? Oh, nice...

98
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,878
...medal you got there.

99
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,234
It's a Navy Cross.

100
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,914
My uncle was in the Navy,
but he didn't look like you.

101
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,956
- What is that?
- This?

102
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,268
It's Mace.

103
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,792
All right. Listen, I have to look busy,
so why don't you let me take your bag?

104
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,711
If I don't, I could get fired.

105
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,713
If I get fired, I won't have enough money
for college, and I'll be poor.

106
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,670
This will work. I like this.

107
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,229
What compartment did you say
you were in?

108
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,232
My compartment.

109
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,753
Captain Gilder...

110
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,672
...fancy meeting you here.

111
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,835
Have some champagne, Captain Trilling.

112
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,710
Good things come to those who wait.

113
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,993
Okay, you waited.

114
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,119
<i>Colorado Air Base, this is</i>
<i>Chopper Whiskey Bravo requesting...</i>

115
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,199
Hold it!

116
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,039
I was wondering what that girl
over there is drinking.

117
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,918
The little girl with the tonic and lime
and the bad ID?

118
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,308
That's the one.

119
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,191
- You're not drinking?
- No.

120
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,230
Join me. I don't like drinking alone.

121
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,595
There's no alcohol in that.

122
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,079
Yeah, you always knew everything,
anyway.

123
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,189
Do you think we could have
a pleasant conversation?

124
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,634
Sure.

125
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,957
Let's talk about why you
and my dad stopped talking.

126
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,035
Listen...

127
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,033
...I know that your father
and I had our differences...

128
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,116
...but that doesn't mean I didn't love him.

129
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,872
But you didn't even talk.

130
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,276
Time goes by...

131
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,114
...it seems to fly, and before you know it...

132
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,233
...things happen.

133
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,832
But I never thought...

134
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,230
...I'd never get a chance
to straighten things out with him.

135
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,309
You know...

136
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,791
...he didn't get the medals in the service
by being a choirboy.

137
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,918
I don't want you talking
about my father that way.

138
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,558
I need a drink.

139
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,436
What's the strongest stuff you got?

140
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,510
How about Puerto Rican Rum?

141
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,759
Uncle Casey...

142
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,315
I don't want to fight.

143
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,072
I just promised myself before I got here,
that I would tell you how I felt.

144
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,355
Now...

145
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,437
...let's just be friends.

146
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,108
Okay.

147
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,315
I'm going for a walk.

148
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,234
- What's up?
- What's in there?

149
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,756
It's top secret. I can't let you get in there.

150
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,670
What's in there?

151
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,639
Don't make me restrain you,
because I've been working out, see?

152
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,919
It'd be easy to do that.

153
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,479
Okay. Restrain me.

154
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,795
You want me to?

155
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,790
Yeah.

156
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,992
All right, if you say so. It'll be real easy.

157
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,755
There's a mop...

158
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,549
...a broom and a lot of smelly stuff
you want to avoid.

159
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,199
Who taught you that?

160
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,432
When I was 11 years old,
my uncle taught me all this neat stuff.

161
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,036
That's the dude that's with you?

162
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,950
Yeah...

163
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,553
...I guess.

164
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,828
I can do that.

165
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,033
What are you writing?

166
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,437
It's a book. My memoirs, stuff like that.

167
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,997
Aren't you too young
to be writing your memoirs?

168
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,274
I know it's against the rules,
but give me a shot of something.

169
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,471
Can you put those up there?

170
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,909
Yeah.

171
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,557
What's up with that niece of yours,
Miss Bruce Lee?

172
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,358
She almost killed me.

173
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,556
Up!

174
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,595
You taught her all that shit?

175
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,678
I taught her a few things.

176
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,955
She's lucky she's a girl.

177
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,392
I know some of that stuff myself.

178
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,913
That's what I hear.

179
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,600
Usually from you, but that's what I hear.

180
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,270
Don't give him the brandy.
I need it for the cake.

181
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,274
Look at that.

182
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,955
Because the train is rocking,
it's cramping my style.

183
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,159
I'm making this for Sarah
because it's her favorite thing.

184
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,350
Fifteen minutes, on high.

185
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,512
The rest is up to God.

186
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,200
Now, go find Sarah, and we'll surprise her.

187
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,394
What was that?

188
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,118
It's called a...

189
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,555
...orgasm.

190
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,837
Sounds like torpedoes.
We must be in dark territory.

191
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,712
What the hell is this?

192
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,793
They're not our guys.

193
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,118
What's the trouble?

194
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,759
What's going on?

195
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,677
Someone's been shot.

196
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,829
Where?

197
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,189
Here.

198
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,432
Loco secured.

199
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,751
Move! You have four minutes.

200
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,075
Everybody to the back of the train!
Don't make me ask twice!

201
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,635
Everybody up those stairs! Move it!
Come on!

202
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,359
Shut that bitch up or I will! Let's move it!

203
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,279
Get up the stairs!

204
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,553
What the fuck is this? Anything else?
Go! Get out of here!

205
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,510
Open the door to the baggage car!

206
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,958
Check the baggage.

207
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,399
Baggage checked.

208
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,799
Any other heroes?

209
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,870
Trouble in the dining car. One casualty.

210
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,268
Take cover!

211
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,792
Four cooks. Check.

212
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,838
<i>Copy that. Continue with the cleanup.</i>

213
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,758
We leave in 20 seconds.

214
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,470
This, I'm trained for.

215
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,038
Oh, my God.

216
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,149
Dane?

217
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,919
Well, here you are.

218
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,831
The last place anyone would expect
to find you.

219
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,592
Amazing.

220
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,033
Put something on.

221
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,996
Have a seat, Captains.

222
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,193
They said you were dead.

223
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,713
Yeah, very restful.

224
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,631
No phone calls.

225
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,868
You two have been very naughty.

226
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,519
ATAC has strict rules against employees
getting involved with each other.

227
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,352
Is that what this is about?

228
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,111
Yeah, right. I faked my own death
and hijacked a passenger train...

229
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,794
...because I care about who you're fucking.

230
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,077
No, I wondered what other rules
you'd be willing to break.

231
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,871
On-line transmission's ready, sir.

232
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,393
Don't go away.

233
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,671
Good evening, everyone.
This is your captor speaking.

234
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,270
There's been a slight change
in your travel plans tonight.

235
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,394
<i>You have, you will note, been moved</i>
<i>to the last two cars of the train...</i>

236
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,198
<i>... for your own well-being.</i>

237
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,068
<i>First, I'd like to call your attention</i>
<i>to the highly trained men...</i>

238
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,435
<i>... with the automatic weapons in your cars.</i>

239
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,911
<i>In the event of an emergency,</i>
<i>they may be called upon to shoot you.</i>

240
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,278
<i>Your safety is our primary concern.</i>

241
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,194
<i>However, if you try anything stupid...</i>

242
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,592
<i>... federal regulations require that I kill you.</i>

243
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,914
He's insane.

244
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,718
<i>So, please...</i>

245
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,313
<i>... no hero shit.</i>

246
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,277
Your access code, please.

247
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,238
I'll never...

248
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,958
...give you the code.

249
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,471
The psychological profile we have
on you says you will.

250
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,951
However, if you wish
to prove the profile incorrect...

251
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,709
...sit back and see what happens
when an intensely hot needle...

252
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,078
...penetrates the lens of one
of the most beautiful eyes on earth.

253
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,438
The needle point will pass through the lens
with very little difficulty.

254
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,438
The heat will cauterize and seal the wound.

255
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,632
But the instrument will continue
to transfer heat...

256
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,711
...to the fluid in the eyeball.

257
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,674
The fluid comes to a boil and...

258
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,318
...the eyeball itself...

259
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,594
...explodes.

260
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,716
J-B-N-1...

261
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,352
...2- 1.

262
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,872
He can't use it.

263
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,675
Why do you think he's doing this?

264
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,833
Because he's crazy.

265
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,554
You can argue that point later. Next!

266
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,553
Are we up for this?

267
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,353
You can't hack into the system.
There are quadruple blocks.

268
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,672
Even if he could, the codes need
to be entered simultaneously.

269
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,749
There's not enough power here.
You've seen the ATAC generators.

270
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,708
Oh, for Christ's sake, it's impossible!

271
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,518
You know that!

272
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,592
The codes are different!
You can't use them anymore!

273
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,319
It's no good! He can't use them!

274
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,278
For God's sake, please, give him the code!
Give him the code!

275
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,318
E-U-I...

276
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,510
...4- 7-6.

277
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,393
I not only invented Grazer, I've updated it...

278
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,508
...to use part of the electromagnetic
spectrum ATAC is only dimly aware of.

279
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,999
What is that?

280
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,279
As long as we're moving,
the signal is completely transparent.

281
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,918
As you can see...

282
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,789
...we're on a choo-choo.
No stop signs for six hours.

283
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,913
ATAC would kill to get a hold
of this technology.

284
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,115
In fact...

285
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,438
...I'm sure they'll try.

286
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,429
Works just as well underground,
underwater.

287
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,550
I not only designed the system...

288
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,432
...I designed the blocks.

289
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,638
What're you doing, Dane?

290
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,709
I'm hacking into ATAC, Linda.

291
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,469
Now...

292
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,755
...watch...

293
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,148
...this.

294
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,752
It's mine again.

295
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,033
Shut the fuck up!

296
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,669
We're locked.

297
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,552
Oh, they're still here.

298
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,598
I don't need them anymore.
They can go now.

299
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,268
Move it, asshole!

300
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,352
Come on, gorgeous.

301
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,752
Don't you know that man's crazy?
Do you realize what he could do?

302
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,671
He's paying me a lot of money.

303
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,398
That's why you're doing this?

304
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,474
Goddamn it.

305
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,998
Three-hundred thousand pages of code...

306
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,358
...or 60 minutes of triple-X interactive...

307
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,869
...rubber-and-leather-bondage porno.

308
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,998
Technology can be used for beauty...

309
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,079
...or debasement.

310
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,157
And until you plug it in...

311
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,833
...you just can't tell.

312
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,628
I seem to have brought
the targeting codes.

313
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,069
I want every window and door locked
and secured. Airtight.

314
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,355
Shit.

315
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,718
The train is secure.

316
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,156
The major installation is T minus ten.
The phone lines are two.

317
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,312
We're sweeping the train for stragglers.
Excuse me.

318
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,709
Wow!

319
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,799
Okay, people...

320
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,598
...let's start this party.

321
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,519
What's going on?

322
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,958
Captain, give me a report.

323
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,632
I'm still searching.

324
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,554
Try this.

325
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,710
- What is it?
- It's gone, sir.

326
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,950
- What's gone?
- Grazer One.

327
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,912
What do you mean, it's gone?
Bring it up on the screen.

328
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,918
It's like someone took it.

329
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,718
How could someone take it?

330
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,632
Nobody knows it's there.

331
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,469
- Find the damn thing.
- We designed it to be undetectable.

332
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,915
But not from us, for Christ's sake!

333
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,833
I want a full systems-check in two minutes.

334
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,158
We're in Code 2 status.

335
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,070
Code 2.

336
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,152
Gilder, Trilling and Tom Breaker, ASAP.

337
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,792
All right, let's move it!

338
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,197
Mr. Penn, ATAC is now locked out
of their own system.

339
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,192
Grazer One is fully under my control.

340
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,033
I thought you were one
of those ugly men with guns.

341
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,593
What are you doing?

342
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,956
It was just a nice day for a stroll.
What's in here?

343
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,231
It's the baggage car, but don't go in.
They shot at me in there.

344
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,912
What are you doing?

345
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,593
Trying to get killed?

346
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,796
There are guys with guns out there.

347
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,235
Come here.

348
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,268
- I ain't coming out there.
- Don't make me yell. Come here.

349
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,833
Investors on the line?

350
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,117
Clients from Asia and the Middle East
are standing by, sir.

351
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,355
Gentlemen.

352
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,513
How are we today? How's the weather
out there? Sunny and sandy?

353
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,439
Now, look, it's demonstration time.

354
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,715
Some of you have trouble
with the idea of...

355
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,917
...a non-terrestrially originated
seismic event.

356
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,073
But I want you to watch China very closely
for the next ten minutes.

357
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,959
- What's the problem?
- The system won't let us in.

358
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,759
The system? What do you mean?
We are the system.

359
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,673
- Any word from Gilder and Trilling?
- We're still looking.

360
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,159
You lose them, too?

361
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,475
This is where the shit will really start
to fly. A fertilizer plant in Guangzhou.

362
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,353
A fertilizer plant?

363
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,359
Yeah, I'm going to shock the world
by spreading ca-ca all over the place.

364
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,991
Guangzhou is a chemical weapons plant
posing as a fertilizer plant.

365
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,469
We know this.
The Chinese know we know.

366
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,634
But we pretend we don't, and the Chinese
pretend they believe we don't know...

367
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,869
...but they know.

368
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,234
Everybody knows.

369
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,350
I'm gonna pull the brake cord,
stop the train and get the hell out of here.

370
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,551
I'm going to die. I'm a fucking porter.

371
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,153
You're a fucking cook.

372
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,357
You gotta trust me on this one, okay?

373
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,950
Is there a phone or com unit here?

374
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,917
There's a radio in the locomotive
and a pay phone downstairs in the lounge.

375
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,038
I'll try to call the cavalry.

376
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,148
Meanwhile, search the bags for a weapon
or something that can be used as one.

377
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,715
If I even touch a bag, I lose my job.

378
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,432
I'm more concerned...

379
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,070
...about the lives of these people
being held as hostages.

380
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,075
The hostages.

381
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,752
I don't want them hurt.

382
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,988
Now, pay close attention, Mr. Penn.

383
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,432
I'm about to make the Bhopal disaster
look like a Girl Scout picnic.

384
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,193
There. It's back.

385
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,751
You see, it's nothing. A minor glitch.
False alarm.

386
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,553
What the hell is that?

387
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,313
Poison gas, chemical fire...

388
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,592
...total devastation for a 100-mile radius.

389
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,030
Thousands of people are going to die.

390
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,597
Just listen and do what I say.

391
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,159
Cover and concealment...

392
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,310
...you know as much as anybody!

393
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,796
Right.

394
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,871
Take that white jacket off.

395
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,871
You touch me again, it's your ass.

396
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,154
Targeting codes.

397
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,198
- They've started our targeting sequence.
- It's arming.

398
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,431
This is nuts. There must be
some kind of malfunction.

399
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,631
It's being controlled elsewhere.

400
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,829
Oh, Jesus, the target's mainland China.

401
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,113
Not China!

402
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,713
Not somebody nuclear.

403
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,199
What's going on?

404
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,670
Sweet Jesus!

405
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,830
She's into acquisition mode.

406
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,598
Somebody shut it down!

407
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,438
<i>They fired me.</i>

408
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,350
Took everything.

409
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,953
She's powering up for a hit.

410
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,917
<i>Said the technology wasn't essential.</i>

411
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,671
Blow it!

412
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,239
Shut it down!

413
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,113
No response.

414
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,111
They wanted it! They'll get it!

415
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,716
That's what Dane used to say.

416
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,915
Call Admiral Bates at the Pentagon.

417
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,919
Admiral Bates is here in Colorado
attending an air show.

418
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,637
Then get him here, now.

419
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,878
Gentlemen, as you can see, it works.

420
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,159
This is a one-time offer.

421
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,517
Two hundred feet below the Pentagon,
is an itty-bitty crack...

422
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,797
...which I propose to make great,
big and wide.

423
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,077
Directly above it
is a strike-hard nuclear reactor.

424
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,552
It ain't hard enough.

425
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,031
We'll take out the Pentagon...

426
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,553
...and God...

427
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,755
...Allah...

428
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,512
...and the wind's willing...

429
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,637
...Washington and most
of the Eastern Seaboard as well.

430
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,633
The fee:

431
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,030
One billion dollars.

432
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,031
A billion dollars.

433
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,873
I owe people money.

434
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,349
Oh, shit.

435
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,152
What is this place?

436
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,116
Here we go.

437
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,272
- I don't know, nor does Congress.
- Who's paying for it?

438
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,391
What the hell is going on?

439
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,555
Don't say this is just a weather station.

440
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,318
Bring the rendering up.

441
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,319
Recently we deployed
a particle-beam weapon into orbit.

442
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,033
In English, please.

443
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,432
It's a major cash cow. Particle-beam
technology, it's the earthquake deal.

444
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,399
It's my understanding
we shut that program down.

445
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,753
We financed it.

446
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,279
Breaker, what?

447
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,515
This goddamn thing works now?

448
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,592
It works so effectively...

449
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,593
...that if we targeted the Los Angeles
fault lines, in 15 seconds...

450
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,556
...Arizona would be beachfront property.

451
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,393
The problem is, someone else
is commanding the satellite.

452
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,948
We couldn't find it or destroy it...

453
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,075
...so we were unable to stop it.

454
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,719
Oh, my God!

455
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,155
China's earthquake?

456
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,071
We have full deniability.

457
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,395
Shit!

458
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,833
That's typical.

459
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,350
Typical Agency bullshit!
Do you know who we're dealing with?

460
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,639
We think it's Travis Dane,
the guy who designed the system.

461
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,518
- One of our people?
- Not anymore.

462
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,592
He was decommissioned.
Last month he was an apparent suicide.

463
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,639
He's brilliant. He can do anything
he puts his mind to, but he's crazy.

464
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,274
Why would you hire a maniac?

465
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,588
Because...

466
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,316
...sane people do not build
weapons like this.

467
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,910
You'd think we'd learn from that.

468
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,635
All right, we're upgrading to Code 3.

469
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,951
Gentlemen, let's find the satellite,
and the bastard, now!

470
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,748
No power.

471
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,478
Cover and conceal.
You know about that, right?

472
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,791
You know about that, right?

473
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,513
One of our customers has
a small personal favor to ask.

474
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,956
He wants you to blow up an airplane.

475
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,476
Tell him to forget about it.
I'm going to blow up the Pentagon.

476
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,630
He either gets on board or gets left behind.

477
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,110
But, sir, the gentleman's ex-wife
is on board of this jet.

478
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,238
He wants you to blow up a jet
going 500 miles an hour...

479
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,790
...with a weapon designed
for subterranean strikes?

480
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,357
He says he'll pay us
an additional $100 million.

481
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,515
Really?

482
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,350
Do we have it's transponder numbers?

483
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,153
Sending them now.

484
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,269
I can do this.

485
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,591
His ex-wife is history
once the money is in our account.

486
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,076
Grazer One will be in position in...

487
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,829
He has five minutes to make the deposit.

488
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,438
The money's hitting Zurich...

489
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,270
...now!

490
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,430
Good. Here we go.

491
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,913
Grazer's back on-line.

492
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,834
- lf they hooked up, we're in trouble.
- Pegasus C Team is in range.

493
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,356
We have a B-2 bomber
with two anti-satellite missiles on board.

494
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,589
I thought you cut the power downstairs.

495
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,839
Pegasus locked on Grazer One.
On your command.

496
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,989
Fire.

497
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,997
Can we get it before it fires?

498
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,559
They are so slow.

499
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,839
- Why is it counting?
- Still getting the feed.

500
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,758
Boom!

501
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,630
Earthquake in midair.

502
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,793
That is the goddamnedest thing
I've ever seen.

503
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,275
What the hell did we shoot down?

504
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,598
I'll ask you again, if we didn't shoot down
Grazer One, what did we shoot?

505
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,115
Check on Herb downstairs.

506
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,600
Train noise eliminated
from the transmission.

507
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,151
Let's get ready to call home.

508
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,708
What's up?

509
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,871
- Where'd you get the gun?
- Get anything?

510
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,916
I got a fishing rod, pool cue and clothes.

511
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,752
You're a useless bastard.

512
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,991
Encrypted, no good. This is a.45, okay?

513
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,909
Dynamic tension, left hand, right hand,
palms pressed together, okay?

514
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,072
Cover your ass, 12, 3, 6, 9,
wherever you look always.

515
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,789
Never look in a direction
where the gun ain't pointing, understand?

516
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,358
Who the hell is that?

517
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,959
Jesus Christ!

518
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,228
<i>Not quite, General Cooper,</i>
<i>although I have sort of risen from the dead.</i>

519
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,954
<i>No, it's just your old friend, Travis Dane.</i>

520
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,680
<i>You remember? The guy you fired!</i>

521
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:30,357
And I bet now you're probably
asking yourselves:

522
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,909
"What the hell did we just shoot down?"

523
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,309
<i>The answer is:</i>

524
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,678
<i>The NSA's best and only functional</i>
<i>real-time down-looking satellite...</i>

525
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,473
<i>... the NSP-1.</i>

526
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,077
<i>You'll probably be calling them</i>
<i>any minute now, asking them for its use.</i>

527
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,550
<i>Unfortunately, since even they don't know</i>
<i>where it is...</i>

528
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,119
<i>... they can't help you.</i>

529
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,599
Have you got him?

530
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,079
I'm closing in.

531
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,391
<i>You do know where</i>
<i>the last transmission came from.</i>

532
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,550
<i>You're probably closing in fast...</i>

533
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,876
<i>... on Grazer One's probable location.</i>

534
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,152
<i>It's in there somewhere...</i>

535
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,194
<i>... hiding among those 50 ghost satellites</i>
<i>I've created...</i>

536
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,238
<i>... just for you.</i>

537
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,438
Motherfucker's gone.

538
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,430
As my demonstration just proved...

539
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,836
<i>... Grazer One is viable...</i>

540
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,230
<i>... and can produce results.</i>

541
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,630
<i>Reproducible results.</i>

542
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,433
<i>And to prove it...</i>

543
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:34,195
<i>... I'm going to give you</i>
<i>another demonstration of my masterpiece.</i>

544
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,999
<i>In 45 minutes...</i>

545
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,676
<i>... as soon as Grazer One is in position</i>
<i>for a clear shot...</i>

546
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,516
<i>... I'm going to hit the Pentagon</i>
<i>with a 98 percent blast.</i>

547
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,278
<i>Enough to fracture the nuclear reactor</i>
<i>you claim you don't have under there.</i>

548
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,232
You son of a bitch.

549
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,833
<i>We'll have fallout.</i>

550
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,592
<i>We'll have devastation.</i>

551
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,792
<i>I've got things to do.</i>

552
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,518
<i>I want you to remember:</i>

553
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,752
<i>I was smarter than all of you</i>
<i>before I worked there.</i>

554
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,798
<i>I was smarter than all of you</i>
<i>while I worked there.</i>

555
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,110
<i>And I'm still smarter than all of you.</i>

556
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,514
<i>Au revoir.</i>

557
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,113
He sure didn't go this way.
We would've heard him.

558
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,992
What are the odds
of tracking Grazer down in time?

559
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,395
We should check over Paris.

560
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,311
Considering the area we must cover...

561
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,152
That's why it's called "space."

562
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,231
What's that, son? Speak up.

563
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,395
Well...

564
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,153
...I was just saying...

565
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,118
...that's why they call it "space," because...

566
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,591
...there's a lot of it.

567
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,435
Thank you.

568
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,033
Just be quiet, please.

569
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,273
Where are you going?

570
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,713
Front of the train.

571
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,313
To look for the radio.

572
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,188
Stay out of sight and don't get killed.

573
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,993
Safety off...

574
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,673
...dynamic tension...

575
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,512
...aim... shoot.

576
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,273
That's their ass now.

577
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,638
Do you know what this is?
This is a Navy Cross.

578
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,313
It's awarded for bravery.

579
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,278
This is my father's.
Uncle Casey's got two of them.

580
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,675
He's got medals that are so secret...

581
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,389
...he can never show them to anybody.

582
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,949
He won't let anything happen to us.

583
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,313
I guess he's a hero.

584
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,835
We have an intruder.

585
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,353
<i>Sweep the train.</i>

586
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,629
Do a sweep.

587
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,555
Found our intruder?

588
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,551
<i>Negative. We're still looking.</i>

589
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,993
You clear?

590
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,513
We're checking.

591
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,875
Nothing.

592
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,639
We're clear here.

593
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,438
Have you checked everywhere?

594
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,033
Check on the roof.

595
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,195
What?

596
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,436
On top!

597
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,873
He's on the roof!

598
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,392
We're under fire!

599
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,394
Go get him.

600
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,077
<i>Got him. He fell off of one of the first cars.</i>

601
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,392
She said he fell over here.

602
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,469
There's blood here. Here!

603
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,675
<i>She got him. He fell between</i>
<i>the first car and the locomotive.</i>

604
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,273
<i>Is this a confirmation?</i>

605
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,911
<i>He's now hamburger. He's probably spread</i>
<i>about halfway across the state.</i>

606
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,674
We got him.

607
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,149
But the bastard took out six men.

608
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,880
You stay here, okay? I'm going back.

609
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,473
Be careful.

610
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,836
You said these men were good.

611
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,593
Who was he?

612
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,271
What was he doing downstairs?

613
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,920
The man is a soldier-of-fortune freak.

614
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,516
Ran a war camp in Alabama.
They sat around playing paint ball.

615
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,512
That's not the whole story.

616
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,354
The relationship between Penn and Dane
resurfaced during Desert Storm.

617
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,398
When Dane apparently died,
we pulled surveillance off them.

618
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,391
We're aware of that.

619
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,711
The connection is tenuous.

620
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,669
Let me tell you what it really is.

621
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,355
It's another classic example
of the CIA not doing their homework.

622
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,949
Excuse me?

623
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,235
In the last few years,
Penn developed a network of contacts.

624
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,756
North Korea, here in the US,
in particular in the Middle East.

625
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,550
Best guess is this: If he's hooked up
with Dane, they have the money to do it.

626
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,556
Why did he need power?

627
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,594
The phone!

628
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,314
Call Philippe, tell him
he's working tomorrow.

629
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,628
Damn it!

630
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,834
On second thought, he worked yesterday.
Call Antoine.

631
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,433
You've been shot.

632
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,478
No, there's no bullet. No bullet in here.

633
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,191
You think this is "been shot"?

634
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,395
This ain't it.

635
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,754
Let's see here...

636
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,036
Access encoded...

637
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,390
Gigabyte of RAM should do the trick.

638
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,711
We are in. What have we got?

639
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,676
"Phone book...

640
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,193
"...recipes.

641
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,953
"Chicken cannelloni...

642
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,679
"...fruit salad with crystallized ginger."

643
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,875
Sounds good.

644
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,235
Where are we?

645
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,072
We're about right there.

646
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,438
There, about 200 miles,
is where we come out of the mountain.

647
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,988
We're without phones for four hours?

648
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,119
"Ryback's Tactics."

649
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,358
Casey-fucking-Ryback?

650
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,032
Jesus Christ.

651
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,750
Who's Casey-fucking-Ryback?

652
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,471
Casey Ryback's a former SEAL Team
Captain, a counter-terrorist expert.

653
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,473
He was my instructor.

654
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,913
He's the best.

655
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,433
I thought you were.

656
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,830
Did you see the body she shot?

657
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,515
No, just a lot of blood.
If you get run over by a train...

658
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,477
Did you see the body?

659
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:23,118
I assumed he was dead.

660
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,350
Assumption is the mother of fuckups.

661
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,828
I want every man
to resume a full train search...

662
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,911
...inside and out, car by car.

663
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:36,232
Including all AC ducting, all paneling,
the roof, undercarriage.

664
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,396
Absolutely everything! Right now!

665
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,354
I can do this.

666
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,793
I can do this.

667
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,470
You think he's alive?

668
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,710
Until I have confirmation otherwise.

669
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,637
What is he doing on my train
besides killing your men?

670
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,439
Check the manifest.
See if he's traveling with anyone.

671
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:17,629
You said your million-dollar mercenaries
would be more than enough.

672
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,153
They are. Print that.

673
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,269
Move it!

674
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,072
You picked the wrong place to hang out
with your legs spread.

675
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,071
No, I'm hanging on right here.

676
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,829
Plus one.

677
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,311
Could be a girlfriend or child.

678
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,119
Could be his wife.

679
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,590
A man doesn't call his wife "plus one."

680
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,194
So what? You looking for some babe?

681
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,559
Some bait.

682
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,879
What the hell?

683
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,239
This isn't a produce list, this is...

684
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,718
Oh, my God.

685
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,789
Who's fucking blood is this?

686
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:02,675
Go back to the lounge car.
Check the bar downstairs.

687
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:06,712
What are you doing now?

688
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,278
What am I doing? I'm making a bomb.

689
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,272
What's he looking for?

690
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,313
Me.

691
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,314
Your lunch?

692
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,638
When do I get some action?

693
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,794
We're going to take a bargaining chip
to protect the hostages.

694
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,951
I want an evac order for the President,
and senior staff members...

695
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,679
...on an Alpha status now,
and try not to cause a panic.

696
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,877
I don't think we have a chance in hell.

697
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:00,590
Hi, honey. It's me.

698
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,236
I want you to take Jamie, and I want you
to get out of Washington tonight.

699
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,750
Go to your mother's.

700
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,398
Yeah, and...

701
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,035
...honey...

702
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,713
...don't tell anyone.

703
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,354
What's your name?

704
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,192
Zachs. Bobby Zachs.

705
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,991
You're not on the list.

706
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,272
I'm an employee.

707
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,791
Where's your uniform?

708
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,159
I'm deadheading, getting a free ride.

709
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,879
Navy Cross.

710
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,435
Mace.

711
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,234
Not Mace...

712
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,112
...pepper spray.

713
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,839
Sold to civilians. Once you get used to it...

714
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,430
...it just clears the sinuses.

715
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,999
Get her and let's go.

716
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,118
Let her go.

717
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,076
Why do you need lighter fluid?

718
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,992
It's like a detonator.

719
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,190
Okay, Bobby, get in the elevator.

720
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,911
I must go beep someone.

721
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,313
Imagine a fire
from New York to Charleston.

722
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,557
We can do this.

723
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,068
Get a man on the roof!

724
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,038
I need two more downstairs
in the next two cars!

725
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,630
The bastard is using the AC ducting!

726
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,278
Computer's down!

727
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,958
Computer's down!

728
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,710
You and you, get to the baggage car!

729
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,228
Get him!

730
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,914
I got the CD.

731
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,638
He's downstairs. Go get him.

732
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,789
Go.

733
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:06,589
Now.

734
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,113
They have the CD!

735
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,839
The targeting CD!

736
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,876
I can't do anything without it!

737
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,470
Let's go!

738
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,754
Don't shoot the intruder.

739
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,273
<i>He has the CD.</i>

740
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,358
Hold it right there!

741
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,553
Hand over the CD.

742
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,997
They're off the train.

743
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,753
Stop the train.

744
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,635
Back up.

745
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,833
This train...

746
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:38,118
...might as well be 20 tons of scrap metal
without that CD.

747
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,148
Hold it!

748
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,554
Come on, move!

749
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,159
Hook up right here.

750
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,959
Wait here.

751
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,953
Safety off...

752
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,232
...dynamic tension...

753
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,076
Ass!

754
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,393
It's the porter.

755
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,119
Check the porter!

756
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,959
You cocksucker!

757
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,150
He's got an accomplice!

758
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,351
<i>It's the porter. We're on to him.</i>

759
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,189
<i>Don't shoot him.</i>

760
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,633
<i>He could also have the CD.</i>

761
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,676
<i>Don't put a bullet in it.</i>

762
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,312
Tell me about the porter.

763
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:08,955
Hello.

764
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,195
The CD.

765
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,430
Hand it over.

766
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,635
Down there.

767
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,631
Where did he go under the train?

768
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,559
Two cars up.

769
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,072
You pricks never learn.

770
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,514
Freeze!

771
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,397
Get your damn hands up.

772
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,751
Up where I can see them!

773
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,832
Where's the CD?

774
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,631
I ripped my pocket. It fell out.

775
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,870
Don't bullshit with me.
Show me that CD...

776
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:55,030
...or I'll cap your black ass, bitch!

777
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,314
Empty your pockets.

778
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,992
Right now!

779
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,399
All right, man!

780
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,318
I'm just a kid. I'm just a kid,
I'm trying to tell you.

781
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,549
- Do it!
- I lost it there.

782
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,790
I ripped my pocket. Everything fell out.

783
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,950
Only thing I've got is your ass!

784
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,191
Porter checked.

785
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,039
"Chance favors the prepared mind."

786
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:32,271
Oh, shit.

787
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,236
Take us west. Full ahead.

788
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:45,875
Oh, shit.

789
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,269
Your uncle wasn't as good as I thought.

790
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,988
You're back on-line. Now, get on with it.

791
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,834
We haven't lost anything vital.
I have enough to do this.

792
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:44,956
Houston, Tranquility Base here.
We are now at T minus 20 minutes...

793
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,315
...and...

794
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,233
...counting.

795
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,110
That bastard started the countdown.

796
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,514
Williams.

797
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,754
Eliminate orbits that don't offer Grazer
a shot at Washington in 20 minutes.

798
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,672
We must eliminate all of them.

799
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,399
- We only have one Pegasus left.
- We don't need one.

800
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,314
On the last one we lock on the satellite
and use the self-destruct.

801
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,073
Make it happen.

802
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,832
Start knocking them off.

803
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,757
- We've eliminated 22 possibilities.
- Excellent.

804
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,353
Twenty-three.

805
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,593
A cook has a message.

806
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,839
He says he has a Code 3 message.

807
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,956
Patch him through on the audio.

808
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:45,359
Is Joint Chief of Staff Bates there, please?

809
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,716
This is Admiral Bates speaking.

810
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,872
<i>Sir, I have a fax message for you.</i>

811
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,393
It reads:

812
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,278
"Admiral, a force of armed men...

813
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,669
"...probably numbering above 20...

814
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,196
<i>"...has taken over</i>
<i>the Grand Continental passenger train...</i>

815
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,920
<i>"...traveling from Denver to LA.</i>

816
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,991
"Key signature equipment of...

817
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:11,108
<i>"...high-bandwidth satellite transmission</i>
<i>equipment has been loaded on board. "</i>

818
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,078
- It's Dane!
<i>- "Aggressors appear to be professionals...</i>

819
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,197
<i>- "...and fully armed."</i>
- Get me the exact location of that train.

820
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,474
Who sent the message?

821
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,754
Casey Ryback.

822
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,116
Casey Ryback?
Casey Ryback's on this train?

823
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,713
What is he doing?

824
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,473
Leave it to Casey.

825
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,591
On vacation with his niece, sir.

826
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,790
What's the closest air-strike group?

827
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,070
Stealth, sir, from the air show.

828
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:42,957
Get them armed and on their way.

829
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,871
There's over 200 people on that train.

830
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,633
There are over eight million people
in Washington.

831
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,191
Unless Ryback performs a miracle
in 18 minutes, I have no choice.

832
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:55,352
Scramble the Stealths.

833
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,759
I'm disappointed.

834
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,076
I looked forward to going head-to-head
with the great Casey...

835
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,272
Man, that was good.

836
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,313
Did he teach you that?

837
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:56,795
Pity...

838
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,318
...you could have been very, very good.

839
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,550
She's insurance, leave her alone.

840
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,711
Ryback's gone, Dane.

841
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,719
Did you see the body?

842
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,909
"Assumption is the mother of all fuckups."

843
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,789
It doesn't matter, she'll die anyway...

844
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,592
...with all the rest.

845
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,720
Ryback may be dead, he may be alive...

846
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,069
...but he is not on this train.

847
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,558
I shouldn't have got back on this train.

848
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,119
Drop the gun.

849
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,035
Drop it!

850
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,400
I never considered myself vicious...

851
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,994
...but you...

852
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,991
...you're like a cockroach!

853
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,193
So what do you do
when the bastard shows himself?

854
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,392
You squash him, right?

855
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,315
You get what I'm saying here, busboy?

856
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:50,874
I'm a porter...

857
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,632
...not a busboy.

858
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,431
Okay, Mr. Porter...

859
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,111
...you got balls, man.

860
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,111
So I'm going to let you decide.

861
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,951
You want to see it coming...

862
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,952
...or to turn around?

863
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,635
Say...

864
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,953
...want to help me?

865
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,035
Shit.

866
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,032
You're a bad motherfucker.

867
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,350
Let's go kick some more ass, though.

868
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,152
Cool, man.

869
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,636
Congratulations, gentlemen...

870
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,837
...there is now one billion dollars...

871
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,549
...waiting for us in the land of banks,
cheese and cuckoo clocks.

872
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:50,633
All we must do now...

873
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,950
<i>... is blow up Washington, DC.</i>

874
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,553
That'd be the fire.

875
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:57,677
You will be picked up at the next stop.

876
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:59,830
Thank you for your participation.

877
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,238
It is sort of true.

878
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,671
You're traveling in another dimension...

879
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:13,479
...not only of sight and sound, but of mind.

880
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,916
There's a signpost up ahead.
Your next stop:

881
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,877
Dark territory.

882
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,790
Who says I have a one-track mind?

883
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,951
The town's on the wrong side.

884
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,990
We're not on the right tracks.

885
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,354
We always pass it on the inside,
not the outside.

886
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,198
Where are they taking us?

887
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,313
8:00, Nevada Petrol Express.

888
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,836
We're going to collide.
If we don't do something, we'll die.

889
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,071
This is a big motherfucker.

890
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,880
It has six locos up front,
about a mile long...

891
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,235
...and has 800,000 gallons of gasoline.

892
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,640
You won't let them get away with it.

893
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,680
No, I'm going to get my bag of tricks...

894
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,120
...and we are going
to rescue these hostages.

895
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,111
That's the Nevada Petrol Express.

896
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,317
It's carrying 800,000 gallons of gasoline.

897
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,238
Can't we contact them?

898
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,949
Not while they're in dark territory.
There is no reception in the canyons.

899
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,429
When will they hit? Will it do the job?

900
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,637
It's going to be close, but...
I don't think so.

901
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,953
We're closing in, sir,
but there are 11 possibles left.

902
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,792
Can you eliminate them in time?

903
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:53,915
No, sir.

904
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,040
Foxtrot Flight, vectoring in on target.

905
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,318
Green light the bombers.

906
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,551
Roger. Foxtrot heading zero.

907
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:11,788
God forgive us.

908
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,714
Something's coming in.

909
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,597
Intermittent signal, very faint.

910
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,272
F-117s.

911
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,115
Stealths.

912
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,272
They found us.

913
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,112
Casey-fucking-Ryback.

914
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,315
Shoot them down.

915
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,516
I'd have to unlock Grazer from Washington.

916
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,797
I don't have the transponder numbers.
I can't target them!

917
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,911
They'd kill all the hostages.

918
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:57,273
Turbulence.

919
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,951
If it moves, Grazer can see it.

920
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,440
They disturb the air as they fly through it.

921
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:07,191
Low-altitude turbulence,
that's how you find these things.

922
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,919
There you are...

923
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:11,598
...Stealths.

924
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,711
I can target these.

925
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,356
Lady!

926
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,714
What's taking you so long?

927
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,552
You've had your two minutes.

928
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,551
We're the good guys.

929
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,189
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

930
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,352
- They split up.
- Is that a problem?

931
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,749
I won't get Grazer onto DC
before it passes.

932
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,273
Come out now.

933
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,354
I broke my bra.

934
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,998
Tits to die for, huh?

935
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,595
Where are the hostages?

936
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:49,398
They're upstairs! Go!

937
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:54,789
You first.

938
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,670
Say good night, Gracie.

939
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:05,114
Got you.

940
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,911
Ryback's hitting the hostage cars.

941
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,592
Good old Ryback!

942
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,677
<i>ATAC, Foxtrot Two.</i>
<i>Target is locked on. I have tone.</i>

943
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,674
Damn, I'm good.

944
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:34,750
Jesus.

945
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,153
Get me the President.

946
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,236
I'm coming to get my niece now.

947
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,719
Come and get her.

948
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:06,879
Why are you bringing Ryback here?
Can you handle this?

949
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,475
It looks like you fucked up.
It's time to cut and run.

950
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,748
Excuse me?

951
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,511
Anyone else think I fucked up?

952
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,269
No.

953
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,518
The cars are separating!

954
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:44,875
What are you doing?

955
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,359
Coming to help you.

956
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:47,589
You're a hero now?

957
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:48,999
You're the hero.

958
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,509
We're free!

959
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:01,279
You want to help? Climb up that ladder
and commandeer that helo.

960
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,351
Are you crazy? Climb up there?

961
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:04,993
It might not work, but try.

962
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,035
Where are you going?

963
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:06,950
The girl.

964
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,034
Tranquility, this is Sparrow.
I'm in position. Over.

965
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:13,192
This is Tranquility.
Hold position as planned. Out.

966
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,631
Hey, bring that ladder closer.

967
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,268
Can't you see I'm trying to be a hero?

968
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,588
That's better.

969
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,998
This is Sparrow. We made our first pickup.

970
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,198
The hell you have.
Get up there and deal with that.

971
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:11,193
What's going on?

972
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,194
Kick his butt!

973
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,868
Honey, we sure taught that boy how to fly.

974
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,515
We sure did.

975
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,559
Now we're going to keep
this chopper right here.

976
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,879
Or I'm going to blow your brains out!
You got that, honey?

977
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:54,796
Let me handle Ryback.

978
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,870
You take care of the techno shit.

979
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,633
He's mine.

980
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,595
I'll take him myself, hand to hand.

981
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:10,471
Come on my little ghost satellites,
I need you with me to hide my baby...

982
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,200
...so she can blow the fuck
out of Washington.

983
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,991
Go get your throat ripped out.

984
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:20,074
I got eight million people to kill,
and one billion dollars to pick up.

985
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,193
Thank you, sir.

986
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:29,829
The President and staff
have been evacuated.

987
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:33,756
Leaving millions of innocent people
to die if we don't stop it.

988
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:35,751
We must use Pegasus now.

989
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,354
But, sir...

990
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:42,510
...we still have eight possibilities.

991
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,229
Pick one.

992
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,349
Now!

993
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:51,916
Kappa.

994
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,595
Thank you. Kappa's the target.
Stand by and launch.

995
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:03,029
I've never been afraid of anybody.

996
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,230
But that uncle of yours scares me.

997
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:11,672
And I like it.

998
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,910
It's you and me... or me and her.

999
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:26,999
Now, you hold on real tight
and you'll stay in one piece.

1000
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,798
Fuck, you ruined my coat.

1001
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:23,349
Good morning.

1002
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,910
Nobody beats me in the kitchen.

1003
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:27,195
I must go. Won't need any of this
anymore. Everything I need...

1004
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:28,794
...is right here.

1005
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,189
The Petrol Express will be here in a minute.

1006
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,633
Have a nice life.

1007
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,392
What's left of it.

1008
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,433
You take one step
and I'm dropping this grenade.

1009
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,355
Drop it.

1010
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,588
Pegasus missed.

1011
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:11,191
It wasn't Kappa.

1012
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:12,789
Jesus.

1013
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,351
Shooting me won't do any good.

1014
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,034
ATAC can't get past my ghost satellites.

1015
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,351
And you can't get past
my encrypted program.

1016
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,358
You mean to tell me there's no way
I can shut that off?

1017
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,509
No way.

1018
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,950
I never thought of that.

1019
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,394
It was Delta.

1020
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,192
We're locked on.

1021
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,590
Hit it!

1022
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,272
Hold the ladder.
And keep this chopper right here.

1023
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,149
I never doubted you.

1024
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,878
Oh, yes, you did.

1025
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:49,113
This is a real sweet
Hallmark moment, but...

1026
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,155
...can we go home now, Uncle Casey?

1027
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,914
This is Helo 505 November-Mike.

1028
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:00,359
Sir, there's a message coming in.
I'll patch it through.

1029
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,634
This is Casey Ryback.

1030
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:03,278
<i>The hostages are safe.</i>
