00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,261
         We'd peek at the girls 
         in the shower,         

665
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,097
              and I'd look      
              at all of them,   

666
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:54,765
           no matter what       
           color they were.     

667
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,233
                   So...        

668
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,403
 Jesus, this is the worst       
 meeting I've ever been in.     

669
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:02,005
   A black man follows me       
   everywhere when it's sunny.  

670
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,841
       Actually, I think that's 
       your shadow, Brick.      

671
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,776
        I call him Leon.        

672
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,444
      And if it's a cloudy day, 
      what happens to Leon?     

673
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,012
                  He goes home. 

674
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:10,981
             It's your shadow.  
             He's talking about 
             his shadow.        

675
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:13,117
     Shut your damn mouths!     
     Sit down!                  

676
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,387
      What's he doing?          

677
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:19,923
      I think you scared him.   
      You can't shout at Brick. 

678
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,092
        Is he all right?        

679
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,394
         Can you sing him       
         a soothing siren song? 

680
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,796
         Just a high melodic...

       along with you.

                 him a balloon. 

686

   Is this for real, Freddie?   

687
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,980
         Linda, I'm sorry.      

688
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:44,982
           No, it's okay!       
           It's okay.           

689
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,917
   So you have a black boss,    
   and it's freaking you out.   

690
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,352
     Is it freaking you out?    

691
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:50,354
                  A little bit, 
                  to be honest. 
 You freaked out?

     you guys get numbers,      

697
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:03,033
 we are gonna                   
 get along just fine.           

698

      Now, if you don't,        
      I am gonna be icy.

702
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,945
   for treasure

   a half a body.

              an inch in

706
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,954
                and I think we  
                held our ground 
                pretty firmly.

01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:47,829
     They're going to love you. 

1554
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,166
    Mmm. This is delicious!     

1555
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:54,135
              So...             

1556
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,337
      How long have you         
      and Linda been dating?    

1557
01:07:56,839 --> 01:07:57,839
                        Mother. 
 (CHUCKLING)                    

1558
01:07:57,841 --> 01:07:59,441
               Oh.              

1559
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:01,309
 No, it's all right.            
 It's a logical question.       

1560
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:03,311
       Um...                    

1561
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:07,115
 Ours is a new love,            
 but it burns very brightly.    

1562
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:12,387
 And it gets hot                
 and sweaty and stanky.         

1563
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:15,256
 There's some stank             
 on that love.                  

1564
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:16,825
      What... What are you      
      talking about?            

1565
01:08:16,827 --> 01:08:19,694
 Let's put it this way,         
 I be busting nuts              
 like a squirrel.               

1566
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:22,330
     Oh, now, we don't          
     have conversations         
     like that over dinner.     

1567
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:22,330
       (WHISPERING)             
       What are you doing?      

1568
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:26,234
    I'm addressing the white    
    elephant in the room.       

1569
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:27,635
 I'm breaking down the barriers 

1570
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:29,737
    of race by assimilation.    

1571
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:31,739
 That's all I'm doing.          
   Well, you're coming off      
   like a jerk.                 

1572
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:33,741
 I think it's going well.       

1573
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:35,276
        LINDA'S FATHER:         
        (CLEARS THROAT)         
        If you haven't noticed, 

1574
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,544
            we don't            
            converse like that. 

1575
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,813
           Okay, okay.          

1576
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:41,116
 Look at big papa               
 down here.                     

1577
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:43,618
 He's saying to himself,        
 "Shit! Look at this honky.     

1578
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:47,255
 "Sittin' at my table,          
 eatin' my food. In my house?   
 Touching my daughter?"         

1579
01:08:47,257 --> 01:08:48,623
     I have.                    

1580
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,191
 I have touched                 
 your daughter.                 
 LINDA: Honey!                  

1581
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:52,293
 We have done things, Papa.     

1582
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,596
 You ain't gonna like.          
 You ain't gonna like it none!  

1583
01:08:54,598 --> 01:08:56,698
        Oh, my goodness!        

1584
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:01,436
   I mean, I'm just a guy       
   from Terre Haute, Indiana    

1585
01:09:01,438 --> 01:09:06,407
  with a big ol' dick and       
  a fat wallet and a spleef     
  the size of a baby arm.       

1586
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:08,543
    Just looking for someone    
    who wants to smoke it.      

1587
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,445
 Let's get some smoke           
 going in this place, right?    

1588
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:12,247
     This ain't no  <i>Super Fly.</i>  
     <i>What is your problem, man?</i> 

1589
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,486
  Linda, I don't understand     
  what you are doing with him.  

1590
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,588
 Oh, you know what              
 I'm comin' at you with,        

1591
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:23,625
 you big black                  
 mother of Linda.               
 Mix it up in a pot!            

1592
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:26,394
 Makin' it spicy!               
          Oh, my Lord.          

1593
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:28,796
                          Hey.  
          In the back,          
          cooking up chitlins.  

1594
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:31,232
    Big ol' titties.            
    Big ol' titties.            

1595
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:32,934
           Excuse me?           

1596
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:34,636
        That's my mama, man.    
 RON: Hey.                      

1597
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:36,905
 Wave your hands in the air.    

1598
01:09:36,907 --> 01:09:38,840
 Wave your hands in the air     
 like you just don't care.      

1599
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:40,675
     Please, don't do this.     

1600
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,278
      Now, which one of you     
      pipe-hittin' bitches      

1601
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,547
      can pass me               
      the mashed potatoes?      
 (ALL GASPING)                  

1602
01:09:45,549 --> 01:09:47,382
 RON: Oh, I don't think         
 that dinner could've           
 gone any better.               

1603
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:48,750
               LINDA: (YELLING) 
               Are you nuts?    

1604
01:09:48,752 --> 01:09:50,852
 No, I'm not!                   
 I had a wonderful evening!     

1605
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,322
      My dad was kicking you    
      in the head!              

1606
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:56,791
      I thought it was like     
      being jumped into a gang. 

1607
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:58,660
       Only with dinner guests! 

1608
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:00,962
      You called my family      
      "pipe-hittin' bitches!"   

1609
01:10:00,964 --> 01:10:02,764
          I hate to             
          pin it on you, but    

1610
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:04,866
          you did               
          invite me to dinner.  

1611
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,335
      I'm sorry. I'm sorry.     

1612
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:09,437
 No, I'm sorry.                 
                    I just...   

1613
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,407
 I'm just under                 
 a lot of stress because...     

1614
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:14,475
               Because Allenby, 
               he doesn't       
               want you to do   

1615
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:15,710
       the story that           
       you're doing for sweeps. 

1616
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:17,879
          "Death From Above."   

1617
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:19,347
 It's an excellent story.       
 Wonderful expose.              

1618
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:20,782
          Listen, Ron.          

1619
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:23,885
            Have you ever heard 
            of synergy?         

1620
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:32,660
     So your mom thought        
     we should get together,    

1621
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:34,262
      spend a little time.      

1622
01:10:35,698 --> 01:10:38,700
   She doesn't think I connect  
   with you as a child.         

1623
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,370
       Can you believe          
       that bullshit?           
       (SCOFFS)                 

1624
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,441
          Oh! This is hard.     

1625
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:49,277
             Things you say     
             to a 6-year-old... 

1626
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:53,448
    Oh! Guess what?             
    I slept with a black woman. 

1627
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:55,550
         What?                  
                Nothing.        

1628
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:58,253
 Dad, do you like Spider-Man?   

1629
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:02,323
      Nope. Don't care for him. 
      Never have.               

1630
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:05,927
       Don't like the mask,     
       the costume, the get-up, 
       the webs. Uh-uh.         

1631
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:08,763
          He comes off          
          like a real dickhead. 
          Real poser.           

1632
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,665
   What's a poser?              

1633
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:15,503
       A poser is Gary.         
       That's what a poser is.  

1634
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:17,338
         By the way,            
         how is that shitheel?  

1635
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:17,338
  What's a shitheel?            

1636
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:21,743
  A shitheel is a real fun term 

1637
01:11:21,745 --> 01:11:24,379
      that you should call Gary 
      every time you see him.   

1638
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:27,849
      When he wakes you up      
      for breakfast, say,       
      "Good morning, shitheel." 

1639
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:30,351
        He'll probably give you 
        $5 or some candy.       

1640
01:11:30,353 --> 01:11:32,387
          Does that sound good? 
     Yeah.                      

1641
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:34,489
 You're a shitheel, Dad.        

1642
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:34,489
                 (LAUGHS) Good. 

1643
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:39,661
        You should just call    
        Gary that. 'Cause it    
        makes him really happy. 

1644
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:41,929
 It makes me sort of happy,     
 but it makes him really happy. 

1645
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:44,966
           Dad.                 
                 Huh?           

1646
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,701
         Sometimes I hear       
         sounds at night        

1647
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:48,469
       and I get scared.        

1648
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:51,372
    I think there's             
    a ghost in my closet.       

1649
01:11:51,374 --> 01:11:53,074
       Now, you                 
       listen to me, son.       

1650
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:57,312
     There is no such thing     
     as ghosts. Case closed.    

1651
01:11:57,314 --> 01:11:58,880
           So what's real       
           that's scary?        

1652
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:00,348
     You really want to know    

1653
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:01,716
      the one thing             
      you should be afraid of?  

1654
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,651
        Yes, I really do.       

1655
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,387
                  Voodoo.       
           Voodoo?              

1656
01:12:06,389 --> 01:12:07,822
                   Yes, voodoo. 

1657
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:09,824
            That shit will      
            mess you up.        

1658
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:12,360
           And it is 100% real. 

1659
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,729
            Promise me          

1660
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:15,630
           that you'll never    
           go to Haiti.         

1661
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:18,066
        I promise, Dad.         

1662
01:12:18,068 --> 01:12:20,001
    This was good. I enjoyed    
    spending time with you.     

1663
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:21,803
            Me, too, Dad.

          go to Haiti sometime? 

1665

   for four days, Ron!

 if we're going to Haiti!

1671
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:39,654

   that you've sheltered him    

1672

    from the evils of voodoo.

01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:44,826

 with him in a healthy way!

      and I'm not trying        
      to be funny here.

 a chance this time.

1699
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:51,058

             about that.

    Brian.

              on that story.    

1702

       call an ambulance!       

1888
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,219
            Damn it, Milton,    
            what is it?

1890

            I, um...            

1891
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:45,492
 It looks as if                 
 both optic nerves              

1892
01:22:45,494 --> 01:22:48,662

 their respective corneas.      

1893
01:22:48,664 --> 01:22:50,364
                 What?          
 No other way                   
 to put this, but...            

1894
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:52,266
    You're blind.

  really misses you, Ron.       

1925
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:13,680
        Jack Lime's been        
        filling in for you      
        since you've been gone.

01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:19,153
   He goes by Jack Lame now.    

1929
01:24:19,155 --> 01:24:21,121
           Well, he shouldn't   
           be doing that.

         She hasn't called.

  Linda's pretty busy.          

1936
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:34,802
 Ron, I'm going                 
 to need your recipe.           

1937
01:24:34,804 --> 01:24:36,570
   So, Ron, what do you do      
   with yourself all day?       

1938
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:38,405
 You're just out here pretty    
 much away from everything.     

1939
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,707
         Well, every day begins 
         about the same.        

1940
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:43,143
            I wake up           
            screaming in terror 

1941
01:24:43,145 --> 01:24:44,678
       because of the blackness 
       and I think I'm dead.    

1942
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,113
        Every day?              

1943
01:24:46,115 --> 01:24:48,215
           Yes! Every day!      

1944
01:24:48,217 --> 01:24:51,185
 And then I begin what's called 
 The Great Adventure.

        Making breakfast.       

1946
01:24:53,456 --> 01:24:56,090
  I've eaten everything         
  from nails to drink coasters. 

1947
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:58,625
         One time I bit hard    
         into a marble ashtray, 

1948
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:00,761
               thinking it was  
               a savory waffle. 

1949
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:05,432
 I wanted that waffle so bad!   
 Completely shattered my teeth. 

1950
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:07,668
         Couldn't you tell      
         the ashtray wasn't     
         hot like a waffle?     

1951
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,471
           No! I couldn't!      
           Because I'm blind!   

1952
01:25:10,473 --> 01:25:14,174
             I'm not blind      
             23 hours a day     
             or 22 hours a day, 

1953
01:25:14,176 --> 01:25:17,377
          I'm blind the whole   
          goddamn time!         

1954
01:25:17,379 --> 01:25:18,479
           Do you have any idea 
           what it's like       

1955
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:20,681
       to drink a half a bottle 
       of ketchup               

1956
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:24,251
    thinking it was a bottle of 
    1946 Chateauneuf-Du-Pape?   

1957
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:27,488
           I even decanted it!  

1958
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:30,491
   If you drank half a bottle   
   of that, that's like...      

1959
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:32,526
        That's like             
        nine or ten gulps.      

1960
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:33,760
     I mean, you couldn't tell  
     that was ketchup?          

1961
01:25:33,762 --> 01:25:35,329
             Did I stutter?     

1962

              I'm ba-lind!

      You know what             
      the biggest indignity is? 

1965
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:44,371

    It's taken me until now

  what the powerful are up to,  
  so that, that power           
  doesn't become corrupt.       

2267
01:39:37,539 --> 01:39:39,539
 But what happens when          
 the powerful own the news?

       Recently, I've been      
       on a bit of              
       a personal journey.      

2271
01:39:47,515 --> 01:39:51,184
    I made love to a proud,     
    intelligent black woman.    

2272
01:39:52,519 --> 01:39:55,054
    I became blind.             

2273
01:39:55,056 --> 01:39:57,657
   I bottle-fed                 
   and raised a shark.          

2274
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:01,060
     And I smoked               
     a fair amount of crack.    

2275
01:40:01,062 --> 01:40:02,462
   But the most important thing 
   I've learned is that         

2276
01:40:03,263 --> 01:40:06,232
    there was an emptiness left 

2277
01:40:06,234 --> 01:40:09,202
    after turning my back on    
    three of the best friends   
    anyone could ever ask for.  

2278
01:40:09,603 --> 01:40:11,170
            Hi, Ron!            

2279
01:40:11,172 --> 01:40:13,206
    So, if you'll excuse me,    

2280
01:40:13,208 --> 01:40:15,575
       I'm going to see         
       my child's recital       

2281
01:40:15,577 --> 01:40:19,078

   that I still love her.

        became of Ron Burgundy.

        can forgive you,        

2301
01:41:17,806 --> 01:41:19,072
      you must learn            
      to forgive yourself.
