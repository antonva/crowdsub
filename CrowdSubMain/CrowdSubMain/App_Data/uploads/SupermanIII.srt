1
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:43,718
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, it's Chicken-Noodle Campbell.

2
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:45,345
Shouldn't you be sittin' in a high chair?

3
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:46,680
Coroner's report.

4
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:48,598
Why don't you just try crack?

5
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,100
You call that humor?

6
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:52,561
The Captain says no more 976 calls.

7
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:09,911
Mr. Love Beads, you'll have to seek
higher enlightenment somewhere else.

8
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:12,163
I'm Lieutenant Cole.
Been assigned to the case.

9
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:13,665
They asked me to come
and look at the file.

10
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:15,917
Didn't mean to be discourteous.
Nice to meet you.

11
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:18,378
I heard about you.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

12
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:21,339
You worked in New York, right?
DeMarco killings?

13
00:03:21,506 --> 00:03:24,342
This ain't New York
and this ain't the DeMarco killings.

14
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:26,428
We work as a team around here.

15
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:30,515
You know, the way I work is
I just like to solve the case.

16
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,767
I don't even care who gets the credit.

17
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:34,895
Beautiful. That's that.

18
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,189
We call this guy, "The Family Man".

19
00:03:37,272 --> 00:03:39,900
He's killed six families
in the last eight months.

20
00:03:39,983 --> 00:03:41,276
All ritual killings.

21
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:44,404
Have you found any connection
between the victims at all?

22
00:03:44,487 --> 00:03:46,907
Other than the fact
that they're all Catholic...

23
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,201
which ties into the crucifixion ritual, no.

24
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:51,369
They just found two more.

25
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:56,583
Fresh kill. Today's your lucky day.
Let's go.

26
00:04:21,566 --> 00:04:23,318
This ain't the same, Jim.

27
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:26,738
Yeah, this is the first one in a motel.

28
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:29,699
All the rest have taken place
in their houses.

29
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:32,160
Normally, we can lD the couple, but...

30
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:35,372
other than that,
it's pretty much the same MO.

31
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:43,630
No, there's a lot more than that goin' on.
I mean, this is different.

32
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:50,345
Are you married or what?

33
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:52,472
This is what I hate about new partners.

34
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:54,724
They always want to get personal.

35
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:58,103
I don't want to talk about it, all right?

36
00:04:59,521 --> 00:05:02,190
Forget that I ever mentioned
anything at all.

37
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,652
Are you married, or what?

38
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,321
No, I'm not married.

39
00:05:08,613 --> 00:05:11,908
Every cop I know who's married,
has a wife who won't sleep with him...

40
00:05:11,992 --> 00:05:13,201
two kids who don't listen to him...

41
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:15,829
and a dog that'd rather lick himself
than fetch the paper.

42
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:18,707
All units respond to a barricaded suspect
with hostages...

43
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,250
at the Saint Edmund's School.

44
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,003
- Possible suicide.
- Yeah, we're in that area.

45
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:26,047
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- It's right over here.

46
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:28,592
No, man. That's suicide. We're Homicide.

47
00:05:28,675 --> 00:05:31,553
If some dumb ass wants to jump
off a buildin', that's his problem.

48
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:34,139
Somebody pushes his ass off a buildin',
then call me.

49
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:36,933
The way I look at it, death is death.

50
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:39,561
We gotta have compassion for the dead,
the dying...

51
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:41,771
the could-be-dying
and the about-to-be-dead.

52
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:43,481
I'm going. I'm going.

53
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,381
Faster, come on. Quickly, quickly.

54
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:12,177
Detective Cole. Detective Campbell.
What have we got?

55
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,179
A boy named Johnny Deverell.
He's a senior.

56
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:16,264
He's got a gun and a class full of kids.

57
00:06:16,348 --> 00:06:17,432
That's nice.

58
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:19,476
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

59
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:23,021
His girlfriend broke up with him.
He's got her up there too.

60
00:06:23,396 --> 00:06:25,023
Has he been in trouble before?

61
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:27,943
He was arrested for drugs.
They had him seeing a therapist.

62
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,529
Yeah, must have been the wrong therapist.

63
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:33,365
Keep everybody quiet.
Keep everybody back.

64
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:37,827
Man, you know this ain't our gig.

65
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,412
Look, it's a love-sick kid.

66
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:42,249
A well-armed, love-sick kid.
Why do you think they got SWAT?

67
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:44,042
'Cause they look good in black.

68
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:47,879
See if you can get me a couple
of cell phones right away.

69
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:53,009
Johnny, please stop it.
They're gonna hurt you.

70
00:06:53,176 --> 00:06:56,596
Shut your mouth, Millie!
I'm not in the mood for this!

71
00:06:56,763 --> 00:06:57,806
Put the gun down, Johnny.

72
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:00,058
- Just put it down!
- Shut up!

73
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:05,647
Johnny, stop it! Please, Johnny!

74
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:10,151
This is Detective Cole, LAPD.

75
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:13,697
I'm not here to hurt you.
I'm here to help you.

76
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,532
I gotta get into a dialogue with you...

77
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:19,786
before the guys in black get here,
'cause they don't listen to anybody.

78
00:07:20,745 --> 00:07:22,706
I don't want you to get hurt.

79
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:27,919
I want you to step over to the window
and look at me.

80
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:30,255
You'll see that I'm unarmed.

81
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:34,467
Nobody move!

82
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:39,931
Come on over. Step over to the window
and look at me.

83
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:48,148
Sorry, Johnny. Put the gun down.

84
00:07:49,441 --> 00:07:51,735
I don't want to shoot you,
and you don't want to be dead.

85
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:52,819
Why not?

86
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:54,696
Drop the gun! Come on.

87
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:58,200
What are you on?

88
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:00,035
Don't talk to me like you know me!

89
00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:02,120
You want me to start shooting?

90
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:11,922
You're right, I don't know you.

91
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:13,882
I'm gonna put my gun down.

92
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,093
We'll start out like this.

93
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:19,888
Now, what's the problem?

94
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:21,848
You don't understand, man.

95
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:25,101
You don't understand.
I can't go back with him.

96
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,937
I can't, I won't.

97
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,771
With who?

98
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:31,024
You don't understand.
I can't go back with him.

99
00:08:31,316 --> 00:08:32,067
With who?

100
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,902
I can't. I won't.

101
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:45,247
I love you, Johnny!

102
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:48,166
I love you, too.

103
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:51,419
I love you, too.

104
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:54,589
I hate this job.

105
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:57,008
- Calm down, son.
- Wait!

106
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:59,344
Watch your head. Calm down.

107
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,389
Now, you see?
SWAT would have killed this boy.

108
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:04,307
You know it, and I know it.

109
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:07,018
- You're not a freelancer, okay?
- Oh, no.

110
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,979
This ain't New York.

111
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:10,063
No shit.

112
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,531
Frank Deverell. It figures.

113
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:22,701
Rich people's kids are always fucked up.

114
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:24,995
Lieutenant, where will I find
Detective Cole?

115
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:27,414
- Right down there, sir.
- Thank you.

116
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,293
- Detective Cole?
- Yes, sir.

117
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,713
I'd like to thank you
from the bottom of my heart...

118
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:37,591
for not letting my stepson
take his own life.

119
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:40,635
You look like a very sincere individual,
and I...

120
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:44,723
really appreciate your coming down.
So nice of you.

121
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:50,312
Well, I sincerely hope that
if there's ever anything I can do for you...

122
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,480
you won't hesitate to ask me.

123
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,233
You'll be the first one I dial.

124
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,277
Let's get out of here.

125
00:10:01,823 --> 00:10:02,908
Nice coat.

126
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:12,417
Detective Cole, can I have a minute?

127
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:14,711
I'm kind of busy right now.

128
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:18,256
I'll be very brief. Mr. Deverell asked me
to speak to you...

129
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,425
on behalf of his stepson.

130
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:21,843
About what?

131
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:24,763
Mr. Deverell feels your testimony
would be very helpful...

132
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:28,058
in getting Johnny acquitted on grounds
of temporary insanity.

133
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:31,478
There's a little problem.
First of all, I don't think he's insane.

134
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:34,856
Second of all, I like to testify
as to what actually happened.

135
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,399
Look, Detective...

136
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:41,821
Johnny's been going
through a very difficult time.

137
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:44,366
He needs treatment, not prison.

138
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:48,787
Now, Mr. Deverell, as you may know...

139
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,749
he's a very important man,
and a man with a lot of influence...

140
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,460
a man who could help or hurt a career.

141
00:10:57,587 --> 00:11:00,131
Just what is it that you do for this man?

142
00:11:00,757 --> 00:11:03,301
I'm in charge of Mr. Deverell's security.

143
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:07,597
Could have fooled me.
I thought you were an attorney.

144
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,808
I want you to deliver a message for me.

145
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:13,812
You tell your asshole boss that nobody,
nobody threatens me.

146
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:19,276
I understand. I'll convey your feelings
to Mr. Deverell.

147
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:22,946
Now get your ugly, white ass out of here.
And don't come back.

148
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,080
The motel victim had some problems...

149
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:34,332
l thought you might want to know about.

150
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:37,043
Besides bein' shot in the head
and crucified?

151
00:11:37,127 --> 00:11:39,171
What are you gonna tell me,
she had a bad-hair day?

152
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:42,007
She would have been dead
in a couple of months.

153
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:43,800
From what?

154
00:11:44,342 --> 00:11:48,013
I found advanced osteosarcoma
and interstitial fibrosis.

155
00:11:49,014 --> 00:11:52,517
If you don't say it in English, I'll beat you
to death with a dictionary.

156
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:56,771
It's a rare form of bone cancer, and this
cancer had spread throughout her body.

157
00:11:56,855 --> 00:11:59,316
- What'd cause that?
- What am I? The Amazing Randy?

158
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,902
We have tests to run, it will take time.

159
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,029
What'd you come up with on prints?

160
00:12:04,112 --> 00:12:06,740
Nothing. I don't think she's local.

161
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:10,076
Neither do I.
I don't even think she's American.

162
00:12:10,452 --> 00:12:12,078
I think she's Russian.

163
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:15,248
Wait, I thought he was the Amazing Randy.

164
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:17,250
Hair...cheekbones...

165
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:22,672
genetic bone structure.
I think she's Russian, most likely Georgian.

166
00:12:23,131 --> 00:12:25,800
You can tell all that just by lookin' at her?

167
00:12:26,968 --> 00:12:29,471
Right. She's an Aquarius
and likes country music.

168
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:30,972
Was...an Aquarian.

169
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:33,475
You see, the spirit has left the body.

170
00:12:33,642 --> 00:12:36,561
What we have here
is a mere broken vessel.

171
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,564
"A broken vessel?"

172
00:12:39,648 --> 00:12:43,860
Anything else interesting about the body
that you'd like to comment on or...

173
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:48,281
She's got nice tits.

174
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,409
Precisely, Grasshopper,
but a little bit too nice.

175
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:05,006
Okay, partner, run this number.

176
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:14,516
Detective Cole's not gonna cooperate.

177
00:13:15,392 --> 00:13:17,519
That's the problem with new cops.

178
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:20,856
They need to be taught
who to pay attention to.

179
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,776
I'd be happy to teach him that lesson.

180
00:13:28,363 --> 00:13:30,699
Put some of our Russian friends on it.

181
00:13:30,907 --> 00:13:33,326
Let them earn their money for a change.

182
00:13:37,205 --> 00:13:39,207
Everything else in shape?

183
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,543
Like clockwork.

184
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:43,670
Everyone's still in the dark?

185
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:47,841
It's a very tight seal, as long
as everyone keeps their mouth shut.

186
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:49,217
They will.

187
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:53,471
I think we've set a very good example.

188
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:12,240
So, why LA? New York didn't have
enough psychopaths for you?

189
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:14,784
I didn't get along with my captain.

190
00:14:14,868 --> 00:14:18,830
Figured it was time for a change.
The ex moved out here with the kids.

191
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:29,132
Yeah. Y'all just go on....

192
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:36,097
No, thank you, I don't know you that well.

193
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:37,641
No, that's tea. That's good stuff.

194
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:40,685
It's deer antler. It's good
for your masculinity.

195
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:43,188
Ain't nothin' wrong with my manhood,
thank you.

196
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:45,273
Let me just have a little sip.

197
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:48,777
This is my favorite movie.

198
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:57,118
Do you know I'm black?
I have no idea what you're saying.

199
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:59,454
She says that movie always makes her cry.

200
00:14:59,538 --> 00:15:01,748
Yeah, that's a real tearjerker.

201
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,210
Not that I cry at movies
or anything like that.

202
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:10,090
It takes more than a sad scene
to break me, you know what I mean?

203
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:12,843
Once in a while you should cry
'cause it cleanses the soul.

204
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:14,594
You could use a little bit of that.

205
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:17,806
If I need cleansing, I have a bran muffin.
Thank you.

206
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:20,141
You ain't gonna find one here.

207
00:15:21,977 --> 00:15:22,727
Shit.

208
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:25,021
I think I'm allergic to the incense.

209
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,902
Y'all sell roaches?
Damn, I'm in the wrong business.

210
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:34,239
I could make money
and never leave my apartment.

211
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:38,702
Just put this underneath your tongue.

212
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:41,872
It's perfect for allergies.
It'll clear you right up.

213
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,750
This is bitter.

214
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,419
Bitter? I don't know why it'd be bitter.

215
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:48,753
What is this?

216
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:53,425
It's just a little bit of powdered deer penis.

217
00:15:57,387 --> 00:16:01,975
That's real funny. That's real fuckin' funny.
Damn, do I feel violated.

218
00:16:12,277 --> 00:16:14,404
So tell me, what's up with the beads?

219
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:18,116
These here? It's called a mahla.
Tibetan prayer beads.

220
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:19,784
What do you use 'em for?

221
00:16:19,868 --> 00:16:23,246
I use them to calm my mind
and to purify my thoughts.

222
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:26,166
Yeah, I use Jack Daniel's.

223
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:27,918
We're tryin' to go to the same place.

224
00:16:28,001 --> 00:16:30,420
We're just using a different technique.

225
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:32,506
Except I don't wear the bottle
around my neck.

226
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:35,258
That's because you'd lose your job
if you did.

227
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:38,428
Roden to 4 King 63.
Just got a call from an informant...

228
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:40,931
who claims to have info
on The Family Man.

229
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:43,517
Says he'll only give it to you.
Waitin' on the south dock.

230
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,936
This is 4 King 63. We're on our way.

231
00:16:56,863 --> 00:16:58,532
They're breakin' into a car over there.

232
00:16:58,615 --> 00:17:01,618
We're here to meet an informant.
We don't have time for that.

233
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,870
We're police. We gotta get the bad guys
once in a while.

234
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:06,498
Why don't we get you
some red boots and a cape...

235
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:09,918
and you can fly around the city
and stop all the crime?

236
00:17:21,137 --> 00:17:22,472
Police! Freeze!

237
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:27,143
You know what pisses me off? When I see
some sorry-ass motherfuckers...

238
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:28,895
like you with more hair than me.

239
00:17:28,979 --> 00:17:31,314
Turn around, put your goddamn hands
on the car...

240
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:33,775
before I go get my clippers
and go crazy in here.

241
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,235
Fuck you, pig.

242
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:38,029
"Fuck you?" Did he say, "Fuck you"?

243
00:17:38,113 --> 00:17:41,283
I'm confused. We got the badges.
We got the guns.

244
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,326
You got a screwdriver.

245
00:17:43,577 --> 00:17:46,329
It's kind of like takin' a screwdriver
to a gunfight.

246
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:48,498
And "pig," that's an old phrase.

247
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:52,919
Y'all must not be from around here.
Y'all must be from another country...

248
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:55,839
Drop the guns. Please.

249
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:59,176
This is a police matter.
It's got nothin' to do with you.

250
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:00,760
Drop the guns.

251
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:06,349
Think we're gonna have to do this
the hard way.

252
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:08,727
I can't fight, man.

253
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:12,689
What do you mean you can't fight?
It's a fine time to tell me now.

254
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:14,733
Get down on your knees. Now.

255
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:17,402
He likes you, that's the good news.

256
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:20,405
Sorry. Not without dinner and a movie.

257
00:18:27,329 --> 00:18:30,957
Your friend likes to do things the hard way.
Now, how about you?

258
00:18:31,124 --> 00:18:35,170
My friend, he's a little bit country,
I'm a little bit rock-n'-roll.

259
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:36,546
What does that mean?

260
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,341
Just an expression. What do you want?

261
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:41,176
You...dead.

262
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:43,261
Why?

263
00:18:43,428 --> 00:18:45,263
Because the pay is so good.

264
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:50,060
How about if I double the pay?

265
00:18:51,895 --> 00:18:55,565
You have balls. But I don't think
you have enough money.

266
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:57,359
Well, I do.

267
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,611
I got thousands of dollars in my pocket.

268
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:03,156
I'm gonna reach into my back pocket
slowly to get my wallet.

269
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:04,991
I have a lot of cash...

270
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,244
or you could take plastic.

271
00:19:07,452 --> 00:19:08,578
"Plastic?"

272
00:19:08,995 --> 00:19:10,580
This is rock-n'-roll.

273
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:55,625
For a minute I forgot you said
you can't fight.

274
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:57,002
It's not that I can't fight.

275
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:59,629
I'm not supposed to.
It's against my religion.

276
00:19:59,713 --> 00:20:01,214
- Great.
- I'm a Buddhist.

277
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:03,341
Yeah. You're a Kung Fu priest.

278
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:07,888
Who sent you, man?

279
00:20:08,722 --> 00:20:10,265
The Russian Mafia.

280
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,645
- Let me try.
- You speak Russian?

281
00:20:15,729 --> 00:20:16,980
A little bit.

282
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:22,110
Answer me, goddamn it, before I beat
the shit out of you, you dumb ass!

283
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:26,740
- You speak good Russian.
- Yes. Black Russian.

284
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:30,785
Read him his rights even though
he's a little unconscious.

285
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:35,790
He knows 'em.

286
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,419
I'm tellin' you, Captain, this guy is weird.

287
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:40,921
Yeah, show me a cop who isn't.

288
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:43,673
Look, I'm not talkin' about a cop
who wears pantyhose.

289
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:47,344
This guy, he speaks Chinese,
he dresses like a monk...

290
00:20:47,928 --> 00:20:52,057
and the Russians yesterday, he took
those guys out like Bruce Lee, only better.

291
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,435
I mean, I saw him use his credit card
like a goddamn Ginsu knife.

292
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,020
Where would you learn that?

293
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:58,522
I don't know, maybe the Army.

294
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:01,608
What do you want me to do, Jim,
look at his resume?

295
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,529
Don't come to me with this kind of shit.
Just work with the guy.

296
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:11,368
"Work with the guy".

297
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,128
What does this say to you?

298
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:05,297
Punishment and purification.

299
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:10,677
He believes he's helping these people
by turnin' them into martyrs.

300
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:13,513
Only he can't get any satisfaction.

301
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:15,807
So he keeps doin' it,
gettin' bolder and bolder...

302
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:18,268
until he's either caught or killed.

303
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:21,688
And he ain't gettin' his orders
from the Devil, either.

304
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:24,107
He believes he's listenin' to Jesus himself.

305
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:26,109
You learn well, Grasshopper.

306
00:22:30,113 --> 00:22:31,656
Task force, Campbell.

307
00:22:36,828 --> 00:22:37,996
All right.

308
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,876
Two more bodies.

309
00:23:08,443 --> 00:23:09,528
Hey, slow down.

310
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:12,155
It's all right, man, we'll be back later.

311
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,879
Hey, man, get this virgin
off the crime scene.

312
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:56,449
We got Andrew Dunleavy, a psychiatrist.

313
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:59,035
This is his wife Ellen.
There are two children...

314
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,912
but we haven't been able to locate them.

315
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:03,039
Roden, squash that, man.

316
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:06,084
Are you all right, Jack?

317
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:25,937
- Jim, you got a minute?
- Sure.

318
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:29,024
Careful, he wants to borrow money.
I know that look.

319
00:24:29,107 --> 00:24:32,277
- Got somethin' for you to look at.
- What is it?

320
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:36,198
Found a print at the Dunleavy scene,
on the woman's body.

321
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:38,283
Beautiful. It's about time.

322
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:41,328
- Let's run it right away.
- Already did.

323
00:24:42,287 --> 00:24:43,497
It's Cole's.

324
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,178
Your brother still works
for Intelligence, right?

325
00:25:00,055 --> 00:25:02,807
Tell him to find out everything he can
on Cole.

326
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:04,476
Off the record.

327
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:11,942
We'll extend the house-to-house canvas
by four blocks.

328
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:15,862
We're lookin' for any links
between the victims. Where they shop...

329
00:25:15,987 --> 00:25:18,865
get their cars repaired,
pictures developed...

330
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:20,826
anything, no matter how small.

331
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:24,412
Do me a favor and get me copies
of these blood paintings on the walls...

332
00:25:24,496 --> 00:25:26,289
in this stack of crime-scene photos.

333
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:29,584
Send 'em out to every psych ward
and prison throughout the US.

334
00:25:29,668 --> 00:25:31,378
Maybe a former patient.

335
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:33,880
I don't know, I just think that...

336
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:37,509
this work is so unique that any prisoner,
psychiatrist or priest...

337
00:25:37,592 --> 00:25:39,135
would definitely not forget it.

338
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:41,263
All right, everybody knows what to do.

339
00:25:41,346 --> 00:25:42,430
Let's go.

340
00:26:00,407 --> 00:26:01,825
No, I understand.

341
00:26:03,326 --> 00:26:05,412
I'll get there as fast as I can.

342
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:08,540
Thanks.

343
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:10,333
Hey, you're home early.

344
00:26:11,877 --> 00:26:13,003
What's up?

345
00:26:13,753 --> 00:26:18,258
I have a new patient. They don't think
she has a long time to live, so....

346
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,972
What's wrong?

347
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:26,183
There's been another killing.

348
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,227
Same guy?

349
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:32,189
Yeah.

350
00:26:32,314 --> 00:26:33,690
I'm sorry, Jack.

351
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:38,111
He killed Ellen and her husband.

352
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:39,487
He did what?

353
00:26:41,198 --> 00:26:44,534
I gotta go tell my kids
that their mother is dead.

354
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:47,913
Jesus, Jack!

355
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:52,375
I think he's makin' it personal, you know?

356
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:32,374
Westlake Security.

357
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:38,129
I'd like you to tell Mr. Smith
that Mr. Jones needs to contact him...

358
00:27:38,755 --> 00:27:40,298
right away.

359
00:27:56,857 --> 00:27:58,900
I think there may be a problem.

360
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:01,111
Spit it out, son.

361
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:05,991
Mr. Jones, he's asking to see you.

362
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,160
Really?

363
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:10,996
I wonder what took him so long?

364
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:13,206
What would you like me to do?

365
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,459
lgnore him.

366
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:18,962
He's being dealt with.

367
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:21,590
And we have bigger fish to fry.

368
00:28:22,257 --> 00:28:23,675
Whatever you say.

369
00:28:31,725 --> 00:28:34,227
"Ten Ways To Spend Your Weekend".

370
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:55,123
This is all we could get on Cole.

371
00:28:57,751 --> 00:28:58,877
Let's see.

372
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:03,882
NYPD, Homicide, Task Force Command
on the DeMarco serial killings.

373
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,886
Lots of medals, good cop.

374
00:29:09,012 --> 00:29:11,181
He tracked down the DeMarco killer...

375
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:13,141
shot him on a rooftop, one-on-one...

376
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:16,228
and then was busted for actin'
without sanction.

377
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:18,271
Two coffees, Raffi. Extra sugar.

378
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:20,774
- No coffee for me.
- They're both for me.

379
00:29:21,358 --> 00:29:22,609
Anything else?

380
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,445
Nothin' in the military records.

381
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:29,533
Almost nothin' before the NYPD.
Looks like this guy came out of nowhere.

382
00:29:29,616 --> 00:29:32,452
Are you tellin' me we don't know nothin'
about this guy?

383
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:34,955
Yeah, there's one thing we know for sure.

384
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,666
He used to be married
to the Dunleavy woman.

385
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:40,794
Son of a bitch.

386
00:29:41,962 --> 00:29:46,091
"In my Father's house,
there are many rooms. If it were not so...

387
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:50,303
"...would I have told you that I go
to prepare a place for you?

388
00:29:51,054 --> 00:29:54,641
"Thomas said to him, 'Lord,
we do not know where you are going.'

389
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:57,310
"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way...'

390
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:01,982
"...and the truth and the life,
no one comes to the Father, but by me".

391
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:16,413
Why didn't you tell anybody
it was your ex-wife?

392
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,624
You know they would have pulled me
off the case.

393
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,918
You should've told me.
We're workin' together.

394
00:30:22,002 --> 00:30:23,295
Well, I didn't.

395
00:30:24,546 --> 00:30:28,300
We lD'd the couple at the motel.
Eugene and Sonya Roslov.

396
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:30,510
Russian, just like you said.

397
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:32,679
Any connection to the others?

398
00:30:32,762 --> 00:30:34,931
No. They weren't even Catholic.

399
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:37,767
There goes that theory. What's next?

400
00:30:40,395 --> 00:30:41,938
This is empty.

401
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:44,524
It's everything we know about you.

402
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:46,943
Your background's nothin' but smoke
and mirrors.

403
00:30:47,027 --> 00:30:47,944
Who are you, Jack?

404
00:30:48,028 --> 00:30:49,362
I can't get into it right now.

405
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:51,239
Yeah, well maybe you can get into this.

406
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:53,950
We found your print
at your ex-wife's house.

407
00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:58,747
She was my ex-wife.
I pick up my kids there all the time.

408
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,540
The print's on the body.

409
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,293
Planted.

410
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,962
And there's a puff of smoke
comin' from the grassy knoll.

411
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:08,715
What kind of bullshit
you tryin' to run, man?

412
00:31:09,716 --> 00:31:13,303
I ain't always been a cop.
That's all I can tell you right now.

413
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:17,599
You are one mysterious motherfucker.

414
00:31:18,892 --> 00:31:21,186
Nobody seems to know anything
about your past...

415
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:24,272
and the only evidence I got
points right at you.

416
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:26,733
Now, does that worry you, Jack?

417
00:31:28,068 --> 00:31:29,528
Do I look worried?

418
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:31,947
Well, it damn sure worries me.

419
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:56,513
Hello, Lento's.

420
00:31:57,097 --> 00:31:59,015
No, I'm sorry, we're closed.

421
00:32:00,392 --> 00:32:02,769
- No. It's a private lunch.
- Excuse me.

422
00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:04,688
There is nothing I can do.

423
00:32:06,314 --> 00:32:09,025
I'm telling you we're closed today.
Tomorrow we'll be open.

424
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:11,194
It'll be fine. Come then. It'll be a nice...

425
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:12,779
Excuse me a minute.

426
00:32:12,988 --> 00:32:15,657
Asshole, what are you blind?
We're closed!

427
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,868
You kind of talk too much!

428
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:22,747
Yeah, go ahead, come on over,
we'll give you a table.

429
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,473
You're unbelievable.
What are you doing here?

430
00:32:40,557 --> 00:32:44,102
You need to turn around and leave.
That's what you need to do.

431
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:54,404
You don't call, you don't write.
What's worse, you don't take my calls.

432
00:32:54,488 --> 00:32:57,365
Excuse me. Excuse me, sir...Senator....

433
00:32:59,784 --> 00:33:03,246
Why don't you and I take your
little sensitive ponytail...

434
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,625
and your little sissy beads,
and get out of here, okay?

435
00:33:11,505 --> 00:33:13,006
As I was saying....

436
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:17,636
Senator, as you can see,
some urgent business has just come up.

437
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:20,472
Thank you, Senator, so kind.

438
00:33:25,227 --> 00:33:29,689
It's been such a long time, Jack.
That's the name you're using now, correct?

439
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:31,024
At the moment.

440
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:35,070
Can I get you a bite to eat?
The food is truly wonderful...

441
00:33:35,153 --> 00:33:37,197
although the service leaves a little
to be desired.

442
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,826
Cut the shit. I need some names,
names of consultants.

443
00:33:41,326 --> 00:33:44,955
Don't tell me there's a problem
you can't take care of yourself?

444
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:48,208
It's about the serial killings.
I know you know about them.

445
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,419
Yes, I do. Truly wicked. Sorry about Ellen.

446
00:33:53,588 --> 00:33:54,965
Wonderful woman.

447
00:33:56,633 --> 00:33:59,970
You know, the last two murders
were definitely the work of a pro...

448
00:34:00,053 --> 00:34:01,972
not a serial killer.

449
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:05,767
And I just have the feeling
that you might know who this pro is.

450
00:34:06,768 --> 00:34:08,562
Well, let me guess.

451
00:34:09,855 --> 00:34:11,731
They've discovered your checkered past...

452
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:14,067
and now they suspect you.

453
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:16,153
Not exactly.

454
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:20,448
They're still not totally up on my past yet,
but I know you are.

455
00:34:21,825 --> 00:34:25,120
Therefore, I'm sure you realize
what I'm capable of doing to you...

456
00:34:25,203 --> 00:34:26,663
if I have to.

457
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:30,083
Yes, indeed, I do.

458
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,294
What kind of consultant you lookin' for?

459
00:34:32,377 --> 00:34:36,173
This individual gives me the impression
that he's a freelancer.

460
00:34:36,464 --> 00:34:39,467
Hiding his targets in the scenario
of a serial killer.

461
00:34:39,551 --> 00:34:41,845
Likes a .22, likes head shots.

462
00:34:42,596 --> 00:34:46,224
Seems to be inflicting costume wounds
on the victims after they're dead...

463
00:34:46,308 --> 00:34:48,727
and has excellent cleaning skills.

464
00:34:49,144 --> 00:34:51,813
I'll certainly keep my eyes peeled,
and my ears open.

465
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:54,733
Right now, that's just not
gonna be good enough.

466
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:58,236
Jack, you know there's a problem.
I'm kind of busy right now...

467
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,071
testifying before Congress.

468
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:04,493
They're getting kind of cranky
about where we get our core-op funds...

469
00:35:04,993 --> 00:35:06,828
but, as it's you...

470
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,582
I'll certainly do the best I can.

471
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:12,542
For old times' sake.

472
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:17,214
Good to see you, buddy.

473
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:19,883
Bye, buddy.

474
00:35:26,014 --> 00:35:29,351
If you ever pull that shit with me again,
I'll kill you.

475
00:35:29,434 --> 00:35:33,605
All your little Chinese, moo-shoo pork
potions will not save you next time.

476
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:36,441
You shouldn't knock Chinese potions.

477
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:38,527
I have something in my pocket right now...

478
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,488
that'll completely clear up that bruise
on your forehead.

479
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:42,614
What bruise?

480
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:43,907
That bruise.

481
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:48,889
Do you validate parking?

482
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:57,689
Hello, Lento's.

483
00:36:58,315 --> 00:37:02,652
No, no, no, that' won't work.
We're closed for renovation. I'd say...

484
00:37:04,654 --> 00:37:06,907
two months. Yeah. Thanks.

485
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:12,871
You're chasing your tail with this one.

486
00:37:12,954 --> 00:37:17,167
He probably bought it at a flea market.
No way we're gonna find him there.

487
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:21,880
We're gonna have to go back to basics.
You guys gotta do your canvassing.

488
00:37:22,714 --> 00:37:25,592
- Your phone is ringing.
- You're not listening to me.

489
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:27,844
Read my lips...talk to the people!

490
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,350
Detective, my name is Melanie Sardes.

491
00:37:34,434 --> 00:37:37,187
I think I know who you're looking for.

492
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:43,485
I'm sorry I didn't call you guys sooner,
Detective, but I don't open...

493
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:47,864
my mail every day. There's so much,
it kind of gets away from me.

494
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:52,410
I used to teach art two days a week
up at the prison.

495
00:37:55,664 --> 00:37:56,998
Do you have a cold?

496
00:37:57,082 --> 00:37:58,875
No, I'm allergic to the incense.

497
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:00,627
Can I get you something?

498
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,631
No, thanks. I'm gonna go suck
on some deer penis. I'll be all right.

499
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:07,968
It's a Chinese deer penis.

500
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,220
You put it under your....

501
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:12,389
You were saying?

502
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:16,893
Well, I knew the drawings
you sent were familiar.

503
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:19,479
Especially the halos.

504
00:38:20,105 --> 00:38:22,023
Then when I saw the titian crucifixion...

505
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:23,608
it just clicked.

506
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,486
He was my favorite student.

507
00:38:26,778 --> 00:38:28,905
See, my whole approach is organic.

508
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,490
I start on the inside influence...

509
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,994
and then I try to draw
on the student's inner life.

510
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:38,039
It's about having them find the moment.
A moment without...

511
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:41,334
I've got to hurry back to the nineties now.

512
00:38:41,418 --> 00:38:43,503
Could you just give me his name?

513
00:38:44,546 --> 00:38:46,089
Christopher Maynard.

514
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,801
- We're moving fast on this.
- I know.

515
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:51,386
Where's our warrant?

516
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:53,471
Wait, give me a minute.

517
00:38:56,391 --> 00:38:58,059
What's goin' on?

518
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,312
- You didn't hear?
- No, I didn't.

519
00:39:00,395 --> 00:39:02,189
We got a make on the killer.
Name and address.

520
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:04,065
We're just waitin' for the warrants.

521
00:39:04,149 --> 00:39:05,734
Thank you so much for tellin' me.

522
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:07,986
Well, I figured Campbell told you.

523
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:12,657
Yes, get me Research.

524
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:15,368
Would you do me a favor
and check if there's...

525
00:39:15,452 --> 00:39:19,873
a Catholic Church within a nine-block
radius of 929 Barrow Street?

526
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:30,735
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

527
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:46,710
I had this feeling I was gonna die today!

528
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,171
Christopher.

529
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:53,550
This isn't gonna work, buddy.
Here in a church...

530
00:40:54,384 --> 00:40:55,886
with the priest?

531
00:40:56,344 --> 00:40:58,513
I don't want to be hurting people.

532
00:40:59,014 --> 00:41:00,390
I don't like to.

533
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:03,727
Could I please speak with the priest?

534
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:10,817
Could I have your permission
to please speak with the Father a minute?

535
00:41:11,234 --> 00:41:13,361
I know you don't want to hurt him.

536
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:14,529
Father...

537
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,365
come here, please.

538
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:19,201
Right away.

539
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:29,961
Get out of here.

540
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:38,803
Are they searching for me?

541
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,388
Yes, sir, they are.

542
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:42,724
How did you know I'd be here?

543
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,063
Well, I just took a lucky guess.
It's the closest church to your home.

544
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,525
You're the new cop they brought in, right?

545
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:53,944
Yes, sir, I am. How'd you know?

546
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:57,280
I keep track of these things.
It's part of my job.

547
00:42:01,618 --> 00:42:02,869
So, you know...

548
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,414
you killed my ex-wife, don't you?

549
00:42:11,294 --> 00:42:13,630
I want you to know I didn't hurt her.

550
00:42:14,214 --> 00:42:15,131
You didn't?

551
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:18,426
I only kill who I was told to kill,
who I had to kill.

552
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,220
The Roslovs?

553
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:22,138
The Dunleavys?

554
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:23,807
Did you kill them?

555
00:42:24,224 --> 00:42:25,684
I was spared them.

556
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:28,061
Someone else was called.

557
00:42:28,144 --> 00:42:30,397
Who was given the call, Christopher?

558
00:42:32,148 --> 00:42:34,192
There's too much pain here.
I gotta go now.

559
00:42:34,276 --> 00:42:35,360
Listen to me.

560
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:36,486
You, stay!

561
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,821
Listen to me.

562
00:42:39,197 --> 00:42:41,992
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
My last confession...

563
00:42:42,075 --> 00:42:44,911
was six months ago.
- Christopher, please....

564
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,080
Then you help me.

565
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,124
- You help me.
- I can't do that.

566
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:51,543
I am in hell! I am in hell!

567
00:42:52,294 --> 00:42:54,087
Listen to me. Listen to me.

568
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:57,299
Do it now or I will kill you! You believe it?

569
00:42:58,758 --> 00:43:00,927
- One...two....
- This is God's house.

570
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,054
- Don't make me do this.
- Please.

571
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,723
- Don't!
- Three!

572
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:29,122
This is Maynard's gun. Book it for me.

573
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,586
This is bad, Jack. This is real bad, man.

574
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:36,713
I can't win for losin', man.

575
00:43:38,381 --> 00:43:41,176
I tried so hard not to let this happen.

576
00:43:41,635 --> 00:43:45,805
We tossed his house, we found all kinds
of shit: barbed wire, spikes....

577
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,225
- He was definitely our guy.
- Shit.

578
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:53,522
What the fuck are you doin' here?

579
00:43:53,605 --> 00:43:56,566
Well, I just thought
that he wouldn't be home...

580
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,902
maybe I'd find him at the church.

581
00:43:58,985 --> 00:44:00,362
So, you came to blow him away?

582
00:44:00,445 --> 00:44:03,949
No sir, he drew on me, tried to kill me.
I had no choice.

583
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:08,995
No choice? The priest told me
you let him go. Said he was calm.

584
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:12,749
We'll never know, will we?

585
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:15,585
It's just like DeMarco in New York.

586
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:18,839
You come out alone...the suspect is dead.

587
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,299
Captain, we had a positive lD on...

588
00:44:21,383 --> 00:44:22,801
Shut the fuck up!

589
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,846
I don't want freelance cops working
for me!

590
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:27,973
I want you...and you...

591
00:44:29,057 --> 00:44:31,059
lnternal Affairs, tomorrow morning.

592
00:44:31,142 --> 00:44:32,394
Don't be late.

593
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:47,033
Not so fast. We're sendin' for the poly.

594
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:53,832
So, what'd you tell him?

595
00:44:54,374 --> 00:44:58,211
Everything. The prints, the bullshit past,
the whole nine.

596
00:44:59,504 --> 00:45:01,798
You didn't leave me any choice, Jack.

597
00:45:01,882 --> 00:45:04,384
Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

598
00:45:06,553 --> 00:45:08,805
I'll start by asking you
a few test questions...

599
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:12,851
just to establish a base line.
Please answer yes to both questions.

600
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:15,145
- Are you Detective Jack Cole?
- Yes.

601
00:45:16,188 --> 00:45:18,690
- Have you ever climbed Mt. Everest?
- Yes.

602
00:45:24,696 --> 00:45:26,198
Okay. Let's begin.

603
00:45:29,034 --> 00:45:31,286
You've been a police officer
for seven years?

604
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:31,995
Yes.

605
00:45:32,078 --> 00:45:35,207
Do you know how your fingerprints
came to be at the crime scene?

606
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:35,916
No.

607
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,752
Are you withholding information
pertinent to this investigation?

608
00:45:38,835 --> 00:45:39,461
No.

609
00:45:39,544 --> 00:45:42,047
Did you shoot Christopher Maynard?

610
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,173
Yes.

611
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:45,717
- Was it in self-defense?
- Yes.

612
00:45:45,926 --> 00:45:47,844
Did you kill your ex-wife?

613
00:45:48,762 --> 00:45:49,429
No.

614
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,681
- Have you ever killed anyone?
- Yes.

615
00:45:52,432 --> 00:45:55,185
Have you ever killed anyone
outside of police duty?

616
00:45:55,268 --> 00:45:58,355
I don't think that's pertinent
to this investigation.

617
00:45:58,438 --> 00:45:59,898
It's a yes or no answer.

618
00:45:59,981 --> 00:46:01,024
Is it?

619
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:03,819
There's my answer.

620
00:46:05,111 --> 00:46:07,614
Don't do yourself any favors, Jack.

621
00:46:11,451 --> 00:46:14,788
I've never seen anything like this.
Everything reads true.

622
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,126
Can someone learn to beat this thing?

623
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:24,214
It's possible, but you'd have to have
total control over your emotions.

624
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:27,425
I don't know anybody
who could pull that off.

625
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:30,470
What do you want me to do, Jack?

626
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,098
The prints' thing is bad enough,
but jerkin' the poly off...

627
00:46:33,181 --> 00:46:36,184
just leaves us with our dicks
in the air for all your fans.

628
00:46:36,268 --> 00:46:39,437
You gotta tell me which fans
you're talkin' about. I have so many.

629
00:46:39,521 --> 00:46:41,398
I'm talkin' about Frank Deverell.

630
00:46:41,481 --> 00:46:43,233
He's talkin' to people about you.

631
00:46:43,316 --> 00:46:44,276
Like who?

632
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:45,569
Like the DA.

633
00:46:45,694 --> 00:46:47,529
You never should've been on the scene
with his kid.

634
00:46:47,612 --> 00:46:49,573
About how you put him through a window.

635
00:46:49,656 --> 00:46:51,908
I wonder if that's
the same Frank Deverell...

636
00:46:51,992 --> 00:46:53,535
that came and thanked me...

637
00:46:53,618 --> 00:46:55,912
for not shooting his son
in the goddamn head.

638
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:57,497
Yeah, things change.

639
00:46:57,998 --> 00:47:00,000
Internal Affairs is lookin' at you, Jack...

640
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:02,586
which means they're lookin' at me, too.

641
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:05,797
I'm gonna suspend you
until we can sort this shit out.

642
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:10,510
You know, I somehow think
that you know I'm gettin' screwed.

643
00:47:10,886 --> 00:47:13,305
Yeah, well, tell it to the worry beads.

644
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,974
No one's takin' any chances with you, Jack.

645
00:47:16,057 --> 00:47:19,769
You're officially a suspect in the murder
of your ex-wife and her husband.

646
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:23,148
Give me your lD, your badge
and make sure we know where you are...

647
00:47:23,231 --> 00:47:25,275
'cause lA is comin' for you.

648
00:47:29,321 --> 00:47:31,823
Which one of these did you just piss in?

649
00:47:38,246 --> 00:47:39,247
Son of a bitch.

650
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,470
Capt., you wanted to see me?

651
00:47:54,095 --> 00:47:57,641
Christopher Maynard was with his church
group in New York for two weeks.

652
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:59,309
Keep me posted.

653
00:48:00,602 --> 00:48:04,773
Accounted for every minute. There's
no way he could've done the last two.

654
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:07,067
Cole?

655
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:10,862
You tell me. He was havin'
a custody battle with his ex-wife.

656
00:48:11,363 --> 00:48:14,658
She didn't want him spendin'
too much time with the kids.

657
00:48:15,075 --> 00:48:17,035
Listen. When he was in New York...

658
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:20,747
the DeMarco killings started two months
after he got assigned to Homicide.

659
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,332
He moved here eight months ago.

660
00:48:22,415 --> 00:48:26,336
Exactly two months after that
The Family Man killings start.

661
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:30,048
Maybe we should see what he has to say.

662
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:32,175
What, are you goin' soft on me, Jim?

663
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:34,386
Guy's a weirdo, you said so yourself.

664
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:38,890
Just let Internal Affairs handle it.
They're puttin' a case together right now.

665
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,772
Stay away from him. He's bad news.

666
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,240
I take it something is amiss.

667
00:51:44,117 --> 00:51:45,368
What was he doing there?

668
00:51:45,452 --> 00:51:47,704
Didn't look like he was
after anything specific.

669
00:51:47,787 --> 00:51:49,789
Nothing to worry about.

670
00:51:51,082 --> 00:51:55,253
Got halfway through the place. Nothing
there to connect you to the Roslov woman.

671
00:51:55,337 --> 00:51:57,464
I hope not, for your sake.

672
00:51:58,298 --> 00:52:00,509
You should've gone through
that house days ago.

673
00:52:00,592 --> 00:52:02,928
I'm not supposed to be doing cleanup.

674
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:15,106
Where is she? Have you seen her?

675
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:17,943
No, I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

676
00:52:18,026 --> 00:52:20,445
But this note camejust after you left.

677
00:52:27,285 --> 00:52:29,329
"I cannot go with you...

678
00:52:30,121 --> 00:52:31,957
"...or ever see you again.

679
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:37,254
- "I love you...my darling".
- That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

680
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:39,339
"God bless you".

681
00:52:42,843 --> 00:52:44,803
- What's happenin'?
- What's up?

682
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:48,306
- What the hell you doin' here?
- Gotta talk.

683
00:52:49,391 --> 00:52:52,018
- Those aren't tears, are they?
- No, man.

684
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:56,940
My eyes leak sometimes when I yawn,
that's all.

685
00:52:57,023 --> 00:52:58,441
- They leak?
- Yeah.

686
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,153
- They leak.
- What do you want?

687
00:53:01,236 --> 00:53:03,613
- Let me just...
- Wait...I'm fine.

688
00:53:03,905 --> 00:53:05,323
What do you want?

689
00:53:05,824 --> 00:53:08,368
- I gotta talk to you.
- All right, come on.

690
00:53:10,412 --> 00:53:12,998
What if there's a serial killer out there...

691
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:16,751
he's killin' families,
we nickname him "The Family Man".

692
00:53:17,335 --> 00:53:19,713
But there's somebody else out there...

693
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,382
who has somethin' more sinister
goin' on.

694
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,843
He has to terminate some targets.

695
00:53:24,926 --> 00:53:28,513
So, he kills his targets and
their entire families to make himself...

696
00:53:28,597 --> 00:53:30,557
look like The Family Man.

697
00:53:30,765 --> 00:53:32,767
While we're lookin' for a serial killer.

698
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:36,104
When, in fact, there's two of 'em
and one of 'em is a pro.

699
00:53:36,188 --> 00:53:39,733
- How do you know it's a pro?
-'Cause I know the work of a pro.

700
00:53:40,525 --> 00:53:42,861
I found this in Sonya Roslov's house.

701
00:53:43,195 --> 00:53:44,946
It's a round trip to Moscow...

702
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,115
bought and paid for
by Deverell Industries.

703
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,534
You think Frank Deverell
had somethin' to do with this?

704
00:53:49,618 --> 00:53:50,744
I do, sir.

705
00:53:52,454 --> 00:53:54,831
Sonya Roslov, she was a translator.

706
00:53:54,915 --> 00:53:56,958
If Deverell did any business in Russia...

707
00:53:57,042 --> 00:53:59,127
it makes sense he'd hire someone
like that.

708
00:53:59,211 --> 00:54:02,005
- What if she was a mule?
- Smuggling what?

709
00:54:02,547 --> 00:54:04,883
Chemical weapons of some kind.

710
00:54:06,635 --> 00:54:08,178
Now that the Wall fell...

711
00:54:08,261 --> 00:54:10,639
there's a ton of that stuff floatin' around.

712
00:54:10,722 --> 00:54:13,308
That would explain the cancer in her body.

713
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:16,436
If you look at who controls that stuff
on the black market...

714
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,813
it's the Russian Mafia.

715
00:54:17,896 --> 00:54:20,482
- As in the guys who jumped us.
- You got it.

716
00:54:20,607 --> 00:54:23,193
So, what connects the Dunleavys
to Deverell?

717
00:54:23,276 --> 00:54:26,196
I don't know yet, but I know
we could find out.

718
00:54:26,905 --> 00:54:30,450
You know, they will take my badge
if they find out I'm workin' with you.

719
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:33,411
But, my gut tells me you might be right.

720
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:37,374
- I always go with my gut.
- Okay.

721
00:54:40,418 --> 00:54:44,089
I don't know about you, but I'm gonna
go see the rest of this movie.

722
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:45,674
Is it a good movie?

723
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,927
You've never seen Casablanca?

724
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:52,138
You're asking me
if I've ever seen Casablanca?

725
00:54:52,764 --> 00:54:53,598
Have you?

726
00:54:53,682 --> 00:54:56,434
You gotta be kidding. Me?
Never seen Casablanca?

727
00:54:56,518 --> 00:54:57,978
Have you ever seen Casablanca?

728
00:54:58,061 --> 00:54:58,895
No.

729
00:54:59,688 --> 00:55:00,981
Come on.

730
00:55:02,816 --> 00:55:07,154
And of course, Donald survived
with everything but his pride intact.

731
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,074
I never expected Cole to get this close.

732
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:15,287
I thought you kept better track
of your ex-employees.

733
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,708
No way to anticipate
he'd become this involved.

734
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:23,003
Who is he? Obviously not just a cop.

735
00:55:24,171 --> 00:55:27,549
He was a brilliant soldier.
West Point, that kind of thing.

736
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,554
I found him in Vietnam.
Recruited him for a special projects unit.

737
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:35,807
The Program, we called it.

738
00:55:35,974 --> 00:55:38,602
He handled a lot of odd jobs for us.

739
00:55:39,352 --> 00:55:41,354
- Such as?
- Now, Mr. Deverell...

740
00:55:41,646 --> 00:55:44,399
don't ask about things
you don't really want to know.

741
00:55:44,483 --> 00:55:47,319
Suffice to say, to the people he hunted
for us...

742
00:55:47,402 --> 00:55:50,071
he was known as "The Glimmer Man".

743
00:55:51,323 --> 00:55:53,450
There'd be nothing but jungle...

744
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,952
then a glimmer...

745
00:55:57,913 --> 00:55:59,539
then you'd be dead.

746
00:56:00,165 --> 00:56:02,417
Why isn't he still with you?

747
00:56:02,667 --> 00:56:06,505
He was booted out of the program in '84.
Went native on us.

748
00:56:08,423 --> 00:56:10,342
Made up his own assignments.

749
00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:12,511
Disappeared...for months.

750
00:56:12,886 --> 00:56:14,888
Ended up in Thailand...

751
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:18,308
chanting in some temple or other.

752
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:21,686
They say he was saved by a holy man.

753
00:56:23,188 --> 00:56:27,400
So many stories about this fella,
I don't know which ones are true anymore.

754
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,700
- What do we do about him?
- Broom him.

755
00:56:36,535 --> 00:56:39,454
Time to lose everybody
who knows anythin'.

756
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:43,542
And I mean everybody.

757
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,962
Johnny's no threat.

758
00:56:48,296 --> 00:56:51,758
I beg to differ. He's already spilled
to the shrink.

759
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,513
The poor boy knows too much.
Simple as that.

760
00:56:57,931 --> 00:56:59,558
Johnny'll do what I say.

761
00:56:59,641 --> 00:57:01,893
Let me put this another way.

762
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:05,105
I have four loose links in this operation:

763
00:57:05,397 --> 00:57:07,566
Two cops, you, and the boy.

764
00:57:08,608 --> 00:57:10,318
Three of you have to go.

765
00:57:10,569 --> 00:57:12,404
You can choose which three.

766
00:57:15,615 --> 00:57:17,868
You'll have to do it yourself.

767
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,953
Frank, I'll take care of Johnny.

768
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:22,622
Who's gonna take care of Cole
and Campbell?

769
00:57:22,789 --> 00:57:25,125
I'll put Donald on the others right away.

770
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,793
That's the spirit.

771
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,546
Now, come on in. The water's fine.

772
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:55,192
Shit!

773
01:00:45,492 --> 01:00:47,494
Take the kids upstairs.

774
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:55,752
- John Cole?
- Yes.

775
01:00:56,002 --> 01:00:58,380
Miller and Russo from Internal Affairs.

776
01:00:58,463 --> 01:01:00,632
We have a warrant for your arrest.

777
01:01:01,049 --> 01:01:03,802
Do you want to take a minute
to gather a few things?

778
01:01:03,885 --> 01:01:06,721
No, that's perfectly all right.
I'm ready to go.

779
01:01:58,398 --> 01:02:00,650
Coldest winter I can remember in LA.

780
01:02:01,443 --> 01:02:02,903
Wettest, too.

781
01:04:04,483 --> 01:04:06,067
They got you, too.

782
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:08,778
No, I bought all this shit after the riots.

783
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:11,406
It means we're close, man, we're close.

784
01:04:11,573 --> 01:04:13,366
Do I look like I give a shit?

785
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:17,662
You better give a shit, 'cause they ain't
gonna stop till they get us both.

786
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:24,002
Does this say, "deer antler"?

787
01:04:25,086 --> 01:04:26,588
Give me that.

788
01:04:27,672 --> 01:04:31,009
- It was a free sample.
- There's a whole case over here.

789
01:04:31,092 --> 01:04:33,094
Just stay out of my shit.

790
01:04:33,595 --> 01:04:37,307
Can I just take this moment to tell you
how moved I am deeply?

791
01:04:37,474 --> 01:04:39,643
Yeah, well, that makes one of us.

792
01:04:40,435 --> 01:04:43,063
I found somethin'
on your ex-wife's phone records.

793
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:45,482
Someone called the house the night
she was killed.

794
01:04:45,565 --> 01:04:49,903
They called six times, only talked about 10
or 15 seconds each time.

795
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:52,489
You got a number or somethin'?

796
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:57,035
Could I take those CDs?
They look like I could still use them.

797
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,454
Got it. Come on.

798
01:04:59,621 --> 01:05:02,707
Could I ask you somethin'?
Did you actually live in this shitbox?

799
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:04,417
Man, will you come on?

800
01:05:25,313 --> 01:05:27,774
Now, what if this is really our guy?

801
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:29,943
- We'll reason with him.
- Right.

802
01:05:33,822 --> 01:05:35,073
- What?
- Police!

803
01:05:38,076 --> 01:05:39,703
I'm Detective Cole,
this is Detective Campbell...

804
01:05:39,786 --> 01:05:42,372
with the Los Angeles Police Department.

805
01:05:42,455 --> 01:05:44,791
We'd like to ask you some questions
about some calls...

806
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:47,294
you may have made to a Dr. Dunleavy.

807
01:05:50,839 --> 01:05:53,341
You look like you just came from a riot.

808
01:05:53,592 --> 01:05:54,384
Thanks.

809
01:05:54,467 --> 01:05:56,928
He looks like he just came from a riot.

810
01:05:57,345 --> 01:06:00,891
Yeah, this number's billed to me,
but it's my daughter's phone.

811
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:06,396
I know you, don't I?

812
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:10,692
Yeah, you know me. You put my boyfriend
through a window.

813
01:06:12,652 --> 01:06:15,363
High school, window. I remember now.

814
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:18,617
You're Johnny Deverell's girlfriend,
aren't you?

815
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:19,451
So?

816
01:06:19,534 --> 01:06:23,622
So, I was just wondering, how long
have you known Dr. Dunleavy?

817
01:06:24,915 --> 01:06:27,042
I don't know any Dunleavy.

818
01:06:27,792 --> 01:06:30,587
You called him the night he was killed.

819
01:06:31,296 --> 01:06:34,174
Yeah. Well, it wasn't me.
I don't need a shrink.

820
01:06:35,133 --> 01:06:37,135
We never said he was a shrink.

821
01:06:40,305 --> 01:06:43,099
Okay, I knew him but I didn't call him.

822
01:06:43,975 --> 01:06:45,393
I wonder who did?

823
01:06:46,937 --> 01:06:48,104
Johnny did.

824
01:06:48,688 --> 01:06:51,691
When he got busted with the coke,
they made him see a shrink.

825
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,819
The shrink was Dunleavy, right?

826
01:06:54,152 --> 01:06:55,153
Millie.

827
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:59,032
Let me tell you something, sweetheart,
the games are over.

828
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,660
I want you to tell me right now...

829
01:07:02,077 --> 01:07:05,121
why Johnny was making phone calls
from this room.

830
01:07:05,539 --> 01:07:07,374
He was afraid to call from home.

831
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:08,500
Why?

832
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:12,337
His stepfather. Johnny knew
some bad things he was doing.

833
01:07:12,671 --> 01:07:15,674
Would you happen to know
where we could find this boy?

834
01:07:15,757 --> 01:07:19,094
His stepfather put him away
at Our Lady Of Angels.

835
01:07:20,762 --> 01:07:24,224
You don't think Deverell would kill
his own stepson, do you?

836
01:07:25,767 --> 01:07:28,687
Right. Dumb question.
Let's get out of here.

837
01:08:26,286 --> 01:08:28,914
- You all right, Johnny?
- Yeah, never been better.

838
01:08:28,997 --> 01:08:31,750
Yeah, we need to ask some questions
about your stepdad.

839
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:33,210
He's a prick.

840
01:08:34,169 --> 01:08:35,837
Yeah, besides that.

841
01:08:37,297 --> 01:08:39,257
Did your dad kill Dunleavy?

842
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:43,720
Yeah, I tried to call him,
I tried to warn him, I swear to God.

843
01:08:43,803 --> 01:08:45,972
We know, we know. It's all right.

844
01:08:47,432 --> 01:08:49,976
All right, everybody just relax. Police.

845
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:51,603
Why'd he do it?

846
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:54,731
Okay, he had Donald kill his translator...

847
01:08:56,107 --> 01:09:00,570
because she knew that my father was
smugglin' in some bad shit from Russia.

848
01:09:01,446 --> 01:09:03,365
And I found out about it.

849
01:09:03,657 --> 01:09:07,160
So, he got all freaked out,
and thought I told Dr. Dunleavy.

850
01:09:07,661 --> 01:09:10,372
So he had Donald kill him and his wife...

851
01:09:10,455 --> 01:09:12,958
and made it look
like the serial killer did it.

852
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:14,459
Who was helpin' him?

853
01:09:14,543 --> 01:09:16,127
Some little guy.

854
01:09:17,504 --> 01:09:19,005
Southern accent....

855
01:09:20,173 --> 01:09:22,133
- Smith.
- Yeah, the government guy.

856
01:09:22,217 --> 01:09:23,677
Who's Smith?

857
01:09:24,052 --> 01:09:26,096
You're about to find out.

858
01:09:26,179 --> 01:09:28,265
Sister, take this boy
and keep an eye on him.

859
01:09:28,348 --> 01:09:30,642
Don't let anything happen to him.
Don't leave him alone.

860
01:09:30,725 --> 01:09:33,812
Yes, of course.
I'll take care of you, Johnny. Come.

861
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,237
See you later, Joe.

862
01:10:07,345 --> 01:10:08,597
How you doin'?

863
01:10:10,849 --> 01:10:13,101
Jack, what a pleasant surprise...

864
01:10:18,148 --> 01:10:20,942
You know, in most states in this country...

865
01:10:21,151 --> 01:10:24,821
kidnapping is still a no-no.
Hell, we don't even do it anymore.

866
01:10:24,905 --> 01:10:27,407
Do me a favor. Spare me the drama and...

867
01:10:27,574 --> 01:10:30,285
tell me a story.
What's Deverell smuggling?

868
01:10:31,244 --> 01:10:33,205
I have no idea what you're talking about.

869
01:10:33,288 --> 01:10:34,247
Really?

870
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:38,919
Goddamn, Jack! What are you doin', man?

871
01:10:39,961 --> 01:10:44,299
Deverell's killed four people to hide
something, and I want to find out what.

872
01:10:44,549 --> 01:10:46,593
You're a fuckin' psycho.

873
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:50,138
I don't know what the hell
he's talkin' about.

874
01:10:50,222 --> 01:10:51,515
Well, you're a cop!

875
01:10:51,598 --> 01:10:53,225
Aren't you gonna help?

876
01:10:53,892 --> 01:10:55,060
Okay.

877
01:10:55,602 --> 01:10:57,729
But I'm a really bad shot.

878
01:10:57,896 --> 01:11:00,482
- Stay out of it.
- I'm just tryin' to help.

879
01:11:01,316 --> 01:11:03,527
Kill me if you like, you son of a bitch.

880
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:06,363
I still have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

881
01:11:07,906 --> 01:11:11,076
Jack, I know we've had some harsh words
in the past....

882
01:11:19,793 --> 01:11:22,420
- I tell you I do not know...
- Okay....

883
01:11:28,426 --> 01:11:31,012
I need that hand. Jack, I need that hand.

884
01:11:31,429 --> 01:11:33,932
You know I will. Right about....

885
01:11:34,307 --> 01:11:36,601
All right! Time! Game over!

886
01:11:51,283 --> 01:11:53,160
God I miss you, Jack.

887
01:11:55,036 --> 01:11:58,331
So many young men today
just won't go that extra mile.

888
01:11:59,374 --> 01:12:02,252
I miss you too, Smith. Now, what is it?

889
01:12:03,044 --> 01:12:04,546
Deverell is smugglin'...

890
01:12:04,629 --> 01:12:06,464
chemical weapons in from Russia.

891
01:12:06,548 --> 01:12:10,886
I made the contacts for him. The deal's
being brokered by the Russian Mafia.

892
01:12:12,345 --> 01:12:15,640
Would one of you gentlemen mind
callin' me an ambulance?

893
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:17,976
So, what's he doin' with this stuff?

894
01:12:18,059 --> 01:12:21,521
Deal's bein' done tomorrow.
Some welfare hotel downtown.

895
01:12:21,855 --> 01:12:24,691
He's sellin' it to a bunch
of Serbian freedom fighters.

896
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:26,318
You mean terrorists.

897
01:12:26,651 --> 01:12:28,904
Semantics. You say tomato...

898
01:12:29,529 --> 01:12:32,616
No, motherfucker, I didn't say, "tomato".
I said, "terrorists".

899
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:33,909
You work for the government.

900
01:12:33,992 --> 01:12:36,620
Why would you, of all people,
help Deverell?

901
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:41,958
To get rich, son. To get rich, why else?

902
01:12:42,542 --> 01:12:43,835
You got that?

903
01:12:44,503 --> 01:12:46,213
Yeah, I got that.

904
01:12:49,382 --> 01:12:51,927
Well, aren't you the grown-up spy?

905
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:55,847
What do you want?

906
01:12:56,223 --> 01:12:59,976
I want you and your friends
to leave me alone. Forget that I exist.

907
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:01,228
I already have.

908
01:13:01,311 --> 01:13:02,854
Don't make me come back and kill you.

909
01:13:02,938 --> 01:13:04,272
- I won't.
- Good.

910
01:13:10,737 --> 01:13:14,074
Gentlemen, we must not forget
the little matter...

911
01:13:15,242 --> 01:13:17,869
of the ambulance.
- I only shot you in one foot.

912
01:13:17,953 --> 01:13:19,830
Hobble to a hospital.

913
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:36,513
Well, safe to assume, folks,
that the rainiest winter in memory is over.

914
01:13:36,596 --> 01:13:41,059
Sunny and dry weather for tomorrow
and for the entire five-day period.

915
01:13:41,268 --> 01:13:44,729
Everything we could hope for
in this part of the country....

916
01:13:45,730 --> 01:13:48,900
Deverell is smugglin' chemical weapons in
from Russia.

917
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:52,195
The deal's bein' brokered
by the Russian Mafia.

918
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:54,447
- Who is this?
- So, how's that, asshole?

919
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:57,701
I know you're friends with everyone
from the postman to the President...

920
01:13:57,784 --> 01:14:00,245
but no one will touch you
with a ten-foot pole...

921
01:14:00,328 --> 01:14:01,997
when this shit gets out. Understand?

922
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,665
Detective Cole.

923
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:06,960
You are persistent, I'll give you that.

924
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:10,088
Looks like I got somethin' you want,
you got somethin' I want.

925
01:14:10,172 --> 01:14:12,424
- What might that be?
- Donald.

926
01:14:12,799 --> 01:14:14,885
Donald's your triggerman, isn't he?

927
01:14:14,968 --> 01:14:15,927
I'm listening.

928
01:14:16,011 --> 01:14:17,846
I want him, not you.

929
01:14:17,929 --> 01:14:20,765
Deliver him to me with a nice bow
and the murder weapon.

930
01:14:20,849 --> 01:14:22,559
I'll take it from there.

931
01:14:22,642 --> 01:14:26,730
You take the tape...my name
gets clean...your name stays clean.

932
01:14:27,314 --> 01:14:29,232
Everybody's happy, how's that?

933
01:14:29,316 --> 01:14:30,484
Done.

934
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:33,361
Why don't you meet me tomorrow?

935
01:14:33,445 --> 01:14:37,032
I'm doing a little business at a place
called the Ovington Arms, downtown.

936
01:14:37,115 --> 01:14:40,118
Apartment D-14.
Would 10:00 be good for you?

937
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,919
Why does this gotta be so complicated?

938
01:14:49,002 --> 01:14:51,129
This isn't complicated.
It's nothing but a game.

939
01:14:51,213 --> 01:14:53,256
Reminds me of an old Persian tactician...

940
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:56,301
trying to teach his young troops strategy.

941
01:14:56,551 --> 01:14:58,720
That, later on, came to be known as chess.

942
01:14:58,804 --> 01:15:00,597
So, we're gonna bore 'em to death now?

943
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,767
Young warriors used to like
to fight head-on.

944
01:15:04,142 --> 01:15:06,394
Old warriors like to wait...

945
01:15:06,853 --> 01:15:10,899
let their opponents expose the board,
work themselves into a corner....

946
01:15:10,982 --> 01:15:13,485
Time to go. Sun Tzu, The Art of War.

947
01:15:14,069 --> 01:15:16,822
Sun Tzu. Just keeps gettin' stranger.

948
01:15:22,077 --> 01:15:23,495
Donald's your triggerman, isn't he?

949
01:15:23,578 --> 01:15:24,496
I'm listening.

950
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:26,206
I want him, not you.

951
01:15:26,373 --> 01:15:29,251
Deliver him to me with a nice bow
and the murder weapon.

952
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:30,752
I'll take it from there.

953
01:15:30,836 --> 01:15:33,547
Take the tape...my name gets clean...

954
01:15:34,089 --> 01:15:37,717
your name stays clean.
Everybody's happy, how's that?

955
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:39,427
Done.

956
01:15:41,346 --> 01:15:44,474
Guess your ass just got sold
down the river, shithead.

957
01:16:13,795 --> 01:16:16,173
This won't take long. Just a quick pick up.

958
01:16:16,256 --> 01:16:17,716
I'm sure it won't.

959
01:17:25,075 --> 01:17:26,493
Shabby, but chic.

960
01:17:36,086 --> 01:17:38,088
Either we're a little early...

961
01:17:38,171 --> 01:17:40,382
or our hosts are a little late.

962
01:17:48,098 --> 01:17:50,267
What the hell is going on, Donald?

963
01:17:51,184 --> 01:17:52,394
You tell me.

964
01:17:54,896 --> 01:17:59,151
You think you're gonna hand me over
to Cole. Bad move, fruitcake.

965
01:18:00,485 --> 01:18:02,904
I don't know what you're talking about.

966
01:18:06,825 --> 01:18:08,326
You'll never get out of here.

967
01:18:08,410 --> 01:18:10,495
No, this is my show from now on.

968
01:18:18,336 --> 01:18:20,422
Positively Shakespearean.

969
01:18:21,673 --> 01:18:22,716
"To be...

970
01:18:23,508 --> 01:18:24,259
"...or not to be!"

971
01:18:24,676 --> 01:18:25,594
Time to go.

972
01:18:25,677 --> 01:18:28,555
Wait. We don't know how many guys are
in there.

973
01:18:28,638 --> 01:18:31,933
What do you want me to do?
Wait till they all kill each other?

974
01:18:32,017 --> 01:18:33,894
If the old warriors are patient and...

975
01:18:33,977 --> 01:18:36,271
all the young warriors,
they kill each other and...

976
01:18:36,354 --> 01:18:37,772
that's how we get to be old.

977
01:18:37,856 --> 01:18:39,566
I like that plan too. You listened well.

978
01:18:39,649 --> 01:18:41,401
That's what I told you in the bar.

979
01:18:41,485 --> 01:18:43,862
I don't know why I don't listen to myself.
I'm stupid.

980
01:18:43,945 --> 01:18:45,322
Let's just wait.

981
01:18:46,448 --> 01:18:48,158
Drop the guns! Police!

982
01:18:49,743 --> 01:18:50,619
Put your guns down!

983
01:18:50,702 --> 01:18:51,995
Drop that fuckin' gun!

984
01:18:52,078 --> 01:18:53,205
Drop the gun now!

985
01:18:53,288 --> 01:18:54,748
Drop the gun, boy.

986
01:20:24,045 --> 01:20:25,046
Freeze!

987
01:20:29,176 --> 01:20:30,635
Just drop it!

988
01:20:30,844 --> 01:20:32,179
You, too!

989
01:20:33,054 --> 01:20:33,972
Where do you live?

990
01:20:34,055 --> 01:20:37,309
- Around the corner.
- Well, get your ass around the corner!

991
01:20:37,392 --> 01:20:39,936
And take little Whoopi Goldberg with you.

992
01:20:40,729 --> 01:20:41,980
Jesus Christ.

993
01:20:42,481 --> 01:20:44,274
Showdown on Sesame Street.

994
01:20:44,983 --> 01:20:47,861
Big Bird will pop out of one
of these doors next.

995
01:21:39,371 --> 01:21:40,205
Hi!

996
01:21:51,883 --> 01:21:52,968
Out here!

997
01:21:55,887 --> 01:21:58,807
Hurry, man! I can't hold on much longer!

998
01:22:01,393 --> 01:22:03,937
Oh, God, don't look down.
Don't look down.

999
01:22:05,564 --> 01:22:07,023
Oh, don't look up.

1000
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:20,495
All right, hang on.

1001
01:22:20,662 --> 01:22:22,581
Yeah. That's a good idea, man.

1002
01:22:22,664 --> 01:22:24,749
I wouldn't have thought of that.

1003
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:29,671
- All right, are you ready?
- Ready for what?

1004
01:22:29,754 --> 01:22:30,839
For this.

1005
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:34,092
There's a window, Jack!
There's a window!

1006
01:22:36,595 --> 01:22:39,181
Is that your gun
or are you gettin' excited, man?

1007
01:22:39,264 --> 01:22:40,807
Get off me. Get off.

1008
01:22:41,975 --> 01:22:44,644
Police business. We're right on
out of here.

1009
01:22:47,397 --> 01:22:51,234
- Can you make it down to the lobby?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

1010
01:22:52,277 --> 01:22:54,154
The elevator was broken.

1011
01:23:33,485 --> 01:23:36,279
Has anybody ever told you
you're a real pain in the ass?

1012
01:23:36,363 --> 01:23:37,614
All the time.

1013
01:23:41,326 --> 01:23:43,870
You're not gonna have to hear it anymore.

1014
01:23:45,247 --> 01:23:48,708
I'm gonna take care of you
like I took care of your ex-wife.

1015
01:24:15,068 --> 01:24:16,486
Here we are.

1016
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:21,116
When you wake up in the morning
and look in the mirror...

1017
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:23,618
l think you're probably happy...

1018
01:24:23,785 --> 01:24:27,080
pleased at what you see.
And that disturbs me.

1019
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:31,459
So, I'm gonna take it on
as my responsibility...

1020
01:24:31,543 --> 01:24:35,130
to make sure that you never get to look
in the mirror again.

1021
01:24:35,297 --> 01:24:39,259
I woke up happy, I'm going to bed happy
'cause you're gonna be dead.

1022
01:25:22,385 --> 01:25:23,929
Take your best shot.

1023
01:25:26,473 --> 01:25:28,183
No, I said, "Best shot".

1024
01:25:30,185 --> 01:25:31,144
Boring.

1025
01:25:42,989 --> 01:25:44,991
Is that the best you got, boy?

1026
01:25:47,244 --> 01:25:50,705
If that's the best you got,
I'm just gonna have to kill you.

1027
01:25:54,459 --> 01:25:56,002
Is that all you got?

1028
01:26:14,771 --> 01:26:17,983
You don't look like you're gonna be
wakin' up happy now.

1029
01:26:59,316 --> 01:27:00,400
Hey, Capt.

1030
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,569
You're looking a little rough there,
Campbell.

1031
01:27:02,652 --> 01:27:05,071
Yeah, well, they say I'm gonna make it.

1032
01:27:05,655 --> 01:27:07,407
Guess I owe you an apology, Jack.

1033
01:27:07,491 --> 01:27:09,284
God, wouldn't that be nice?

1034
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,162
Well, you're not gonna get it.

1035
01:27:13,371 --> 01:27:15,165
But I do owe it to you.

1036
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:18,710
Do me a favor,
tell my wife I'm alive and well.

1037
01:27:18,793 --> 01:27:20,170
You got it.

1038
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:21,421
Feel better, kid.

1039
01:27:21,505 --> 01:27:22,422
Yeah.

1040
01:27:24,674 --> 01:27:28,303
Say, Jack. How about we not talk
for a couple of days?

1041
01:27:29,221 --> 01:27:30,639
Somethin' I said?

1042
01:27:30,764 --> 01:27:34,184
It's just that ever since
you started bein' my partner...

1043
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:37,312
I've been beat up, blown up...

1044
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:40,857
shot, kicked out a window...

1045
01:27:41,983 --> 01:27:44,945
all my worldly possessions
burnt to a crisp.

1046
01:27:45,403 --> 01:27:47,364
Basically, I'm homeless.

1047
01:27:48,490 --> 01:27:50,742
Not one good thing has happened
since I met you.

1048
01:27:50,826 --> 01:27:52,410
You got to try powdered deer penis.

1049
01:27:52,494 --> 01:27:53,912
That should count for something.

1050
01:27:53,995 --> 01:27:56,957
Don't call me, Jack.
Don't leave me a message.

1051
01:27:57,123 --> 01:28:01,211
Don't fax me. If I see a bird on my window
with a message on its foot...

1052
01:28:01,378 --> 01:28:03,296
I'm throwin' him back out.

1053
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:04,172
Don't send flowers.

1054
01:28:05,882 --> 01:28:07,634
Forget you know me, Jack!

1055
01:29:06,651 --> 01:29:09,154
