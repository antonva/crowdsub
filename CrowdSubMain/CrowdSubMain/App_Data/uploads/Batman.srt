True Detective - 1x06
"Haunted Houses"

19
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:42,687
I'm gonna go make my rounds.
Only got in.

20
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:47,558
I'll check back with you
in about 20 minutes.

21
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:54,031
I-- I didn't know Audrey's
dad's a cop. I, uh...

22
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:56,100
I didn't mean no disrespect.

23
00:01:56,134 --> 00:01:58,569
Yes, sir, we didn't mean
any disrespect.

24
00:01:58,603 --> 00:02:01,038
Audrey's 16.

25
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:04,675
We got you on statch rape.
You know that, right?

26
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:07,878
You know what happens
to pretty boys like you

27
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:11,549
who go up to the farm
on statch charges?

28
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:25,429
Look at that.

29
00:02:25,463 --> 00:02:27,899
Door come open.

30
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:30,935
Y'all want to step out a bit,

31
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:33,070
take some air?

32
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:38,309
No, sir.

33
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:42,647
I think that you're
a little angry right now.

34
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:45,316
You telling me how I feel?

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,321
That's patronizing.

36
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,658
Two choices...

37
00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:56,160
we do this here
with an understanding

38
00:02:56,194 --> 00:02:58,896
that not you or any
of your river rat boys

39
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,632
comes within a hundred
yards of my daughter,

40
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:05,603
or... file those charges.

41
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:08,773
Got a lot of brothers in Angola

42
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:11,743
who love to owe me a favor.

43
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,485
Now come on out here.

44
00:03:22,554 --> 00:03:24,521
Come on.

45
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,631
Come out here.

46
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,640
Man's game charges
a man's price.

47
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:46,043
Take that away from this
if nothing else.

48
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:48,145
Ohh!

49
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:57,121
Aah!

50
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,428
Please!

51
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,597
Look, I'm sorry.

52
00:04:06,632 --> 00:04:08,232
Please!

53
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:47,839
Disciplinary reports
say he was acting unstable even before.

54
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:49,940
What happened, you and him?

55
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:52,309
Two formal reprimands,
suspension.

56
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:54,812
Your major back then, Salter...

57
00:04:54,846 --> 00:04:57,247
wrote...

58
00:04:57,282 --> 00:04:59,817
"Manic state" right here.

59
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:02,186
No, he-- he, uh,

60
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,256
started pulling
lost time more, but OK.

61
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,759
And for whatever reason, he...

62
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:12,262
started working something
that I didn't know about.

63
00:05:12,297 --> 00:05:15,399
Old missing persons.

64
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,368
What you want, man?

65
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:18,869
Nothing here for you.

66
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:21,038
I'm with the
State Police Department.

67
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:24,909
If you're Terry Guidry, I'd like
to talk to you about your boy.

68
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:30,380
Sheriff call for
a search party?

69
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:33,383
They had a marine
unit out there.

70
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:36,420
Spotlight, everything, and...

71
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:38,556
nothing.

72
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:44,428
Four weeks later, wildlife
fisheries find his pirogue...

73
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:47,565
all broke up.

74
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:51,135
Said it coulda been a gator.

75
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,905
Where'd Sonny go to school?

76
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,574
Queen of Angels.

77
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:59,443
One of them Tuttle schools.

78
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:07,118
We didn't sleep them first
4 weeks Sonny was missing.

79
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:11,856
Drove his mama crazy.

80
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,625
Sh-she...

81
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,461
She thought she heard him

82
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:19,930
under the water...

83
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:23,100
calling for her.

84
00:06:26,638 --> 00:06:29,106
Hey, man, look.

85
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,577
Why don't you just get
out of here, please?

86
00:06:33,611 --> 00:06:37,614
I don't want to get arrested.
Just-- just get...

87
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,784
before I do something to you.

88
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:45,156
If it's wrong, I want it right.

89
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,124
It's all I got.

90
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,626
We're not gonna talk to you,

91
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,596
personal matters
like this, without you--

92
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,300
you don't want to talk about
something, it's OK, no problem.

93
00:06:57,635 --> 00:07:00,604
You sure we can't get
you any coffee, a...

94
00:07:00,638 --> 00:07:03,074
No, thank you.

95
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:05,542
You worried about your ex?

96
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:09,580
It's OK. We are not looking
at him, and nobody wants to.

97
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:13,284
Well, what are you
looking for, from me?

98
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:17,755
Well, perspective, I guess.

99
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:20,324
Something went down, 2002.

100
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:23,260
Your ex-husband's
partner, Rustin Cohle.

101
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:26,430
In a former life,
I used to exhaust myself

102
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:29,433
navigating crude men
who thought they were clever,

103
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:31,402
so ask your questions
or I'm leaving.

104
00:07:31,436 --> 00:07:34,471
That's a cop's wife, all right.

105
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:36,440
Not anymore.

106
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:38,976
We're not trying
to work you, ma'am.

107
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:40,911
Word of honor.

108
00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:44,415
We need to know about
Rustin Cohle in 2002.

109
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:46,817
Why he took off, what
he'd done since.

110
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:50,655
Have you had any contact with
Cohle, Mrs. Sawyer, since 2002?

111
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:53,424
- No, I haven't.
- But you knew him well enough.

112
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,426
I mean, he was your
husband's partner.

113
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,628
Rust?
Yeah, I knew him.

114
00:07:57,662 --> 00:07:59,596
Not as well as other people.

115
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:02,066
Why, exactly, are you
asking about him?

116
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,068
Something bad happened.

117
00:08:04,102 --> 00:08:06,570
Maybe Cohle's involved.

118
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:09,539
More we look at him,
it don't look good.

119
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:13,310
Something went real wrong
with him a long time ago.

120
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:17,081
I knew Rust to be a good man,

121
00:08:17,115 --> 00:08:20,250
so I can't imagine
what I can offer.

122
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:31,761
I mean, Rust knew
exactly who he was...

123
00:08:33,098 --> 00:08:36,667
and there was
no talking him out of it.

124
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,441
You know, Marty's
single big problem was

125
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,943
that he never really
knew himself,

126
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:50,614
so he never really knew
what to want.

127
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:56,453
But I'm big enough to not stay
angry at someone for that...

128
00:08:56,488 --> 00:08:59,623
not after all this time.

129
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,676
Receipt in the bag?

130
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,179
Great.
Thank you so much.

131
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:24,848
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

132
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:32,723
Can I help you
with anything, sir?

133
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:35,025
Oh, yeah, uh, please.

134
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:38,162
I was thinking about this one.

135
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:59,200
_

136
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:05,890
Fuck.

137
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:23,240
Excuse me. Can I get
a dirty Martini, please?

138
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:25,909
- Coming right up.
- Thanks.

139
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:35,552
Big weekend planned?

140
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:37,554
Oh. Yeah.

141
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:39,356
Uh, heh! Yeah.

142
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:42,893
Has all the makings
of a good time.

143
00:10:44,262 --> 00:10:47,264
You're a cop, aren't you?

144
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,766
How'd you know?

145
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,735
I, uh,

146
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:54,671
I think I saw you
before, years back.

147
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:57,174
You get in some trouble?

148
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:59,877
No. Uh...

149
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,845
you came around this
place I was staying,

150
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,014
asking about a girl.

151
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:05,816
Oh.

152
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:07,618
Marty.

153
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:09,753
Beth.

154
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:27,071
We're closed.

155
00:11:30,908 --> 00:11:34,678
You always hit the bottle this
early in the day, Reverend?

156
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,223
Who are you?

157
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:48,758
You don't remember me?

158
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:50,694
Hmm?

159
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:55,232
I came to see you at your
revival tent, January of '95.

160
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,634
Looks like you gave that up.

161
00:11:57,668 --> 00:12:00,637
Mid-eighties. You were still
with the Tuttle ministry then.

162
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:03,340
What do you know about a Tuttle
organization that was set up

163
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:07,010
to finance rural schools?

164
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:12,816
It was called Wellspring.

165
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,820
It was an Evangelical initiative
to provide religious education

166
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:20,824
as an alternative to public
school in the rural communities.

167
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:23,860
Yeah, part of the reason there was
so many dropouts in the state,

168
00:12:23,895 --> 00:12:27,531
a lot of kids had
to bus an hour or more.

169
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,868
You know about that school
on Pelican Island?

170
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:34,404
I don't know it specific,

171
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:37,374
but there was one...

172
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:40,043
in 1988.

173
00:12:41,446 --> 00:12:46,049
Accusations of children
being interfered with.

174
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,887
I never found anything on that.

175
00:12:50,922 --> 00:12:54,425
It was-- it was kept
internal, I think.

176
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:57,894
Maybe it was nothing,
maybe people was paid.

177
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:59,930
It's got nothing
to do with me, mind you.

178
00:12:59,965 --> 00:13:02,366
I was going to school
in Baton Rouge.

179
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,834
Gossip around the seminary,

180
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:07,937
but we didn't give
credence to rumors.

181
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,775
Why'd you leave?

182
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:14,277
Bureaucracy.

183
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:16,913
Politics.

184
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:27,424
Don't lie to me.

185
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:31,428
Why'd you leave?

186
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:40,437
Part of our lay duties
was custodial.

187
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:47,944
One night, cleaned the
senior minister's library.

188
00:13:49,347 --> 00:13:51,815
I knocked over

189
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:54,284
a very old volume,

190
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:56,753
"The Letters
of Telios DeLorca."

191
00:13:56,788 --> 00:14:00,957
Twelfth-century Franciscan
mystic, very obscure.

192
00:14:02,794 --> 00:14:07,464
When I picked up the book,
this little folder falls out.

193
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:12,302
Little folder of pictures.

194
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:17,641
Pictures of children.

195
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,145
Naked.

196
00:14:23,714 --> 00:14:26,182
Looked like they was sleeping.

197
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:29,219
And what'd you do?

198
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:33,257
I took it over to the morals
officer, Deacon Farrar.

199
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,225
He was close to Tuttle,

200
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:37,227
vice president of the college.

201
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:39,696
He didn't do nothin'?

202
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,067
No, he seemed... he got angry
that I brought it to him.

203
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:48,605
He even intimated that maybe I
was confessing to something.

204
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,610
I mean, I had to prove
to him that I wasn't.

205
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:57,614
He promised to look into it...

206
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:01,718
I'd left by the time
Wellspring shut down.

207
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:08,725
Why'd you quit
the revival, hmm?

208
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:14,230
Oh, our last two tents
was vandalized.

209
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:18,602
I lost heart.

210
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:21,238
Little too much of this.

211
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:28,745
All my life, I wanted
to be nearer to God.

212
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:33,750
But the only nearness...

213
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,587
silence.

214
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:42,126
Oh, it wasn't
as bad as it seemed.

215
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,127
Better than most.

216
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:46,096
Jan was a decent lady.

217
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,864
I heard she sold
the ranch a while back.

218
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:50,366
I can't believe that was you.

219
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:52,736
Saved up money for a place,

220
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,004
got a straight job.

221
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,408
I'd run off from a bad
situation when we first met.

222
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:01,044
Well, it's just--
just so great

223
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:03,079
how you turned
everything around.

224
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:05,214
Look at you.

225
00:16:07,585 --> 00:16:10,754
Well, you were
a big hero in the papers.

226
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:13,790
Aw, they made a bigger deal

227
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:16,326
of that than it was.

228
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:18,295
I ain't been...

229
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:20,797
too heroic of late.

230
00:16:20,831 --> 00:16:23,299
Just...

231
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:26,402
You're a good man.

232
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:28,739
Anybody can see that.

233
00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:32,108
I saw it the first
time I met you.

234
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:37,581
God gave us these flaws,

235
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:39,949
and something I learned--

236
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:42,452
He doesn't see them as flaws.

237
00:16:42,487 --> 00:16:46,456
There is nothing wrong
with the way He made us.

238
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:50,493
The universe forgives all.

239
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,769
You want some bourbon?

240
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:08,578
Mmm.

241
00:17:22,994 --> 00:17:25,462
Oh, yeah.

242
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:28,097
Oh, yeah.

243
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,023
What happened in 2002?

244
00:17:53,057 --> 00:17:56,026
You-- you pulled
our last case?

245
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,562
Charmaine Boudreaux?

246
00:17:58,596 --> 00:18:01,030
It was in all the papers.

247
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:04,835
"Marshland Medea."
You know who Medea was?

248
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:06,903
- Yeah.
- We had a lot of static

249
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:09,873
after that, me and him.

250
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:12,208
That was a bad one.

251
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:14,510
I always thought
it contributed,

252
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:17,280
Rust's state of mind
when he walked.

253
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:19,783
SIDs.

254
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,752
What is that?

255
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:24,788
It's a 4-letter word,
S-I-D-S,

256
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:27,291
but, I mean...

257
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:29,425
what is it?

258
00:18:32,329 --> 00:18:34,297
It's an old word,

259
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:36,767
like a curse.

260
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:40,103
Not a language anyone speaks.

261
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:43,974
But it's what happened
to Jessica,

262
00:18:44,008 --> 00:18:46,442
your first.

263
00:18:46,477 --> 00:18:50,446
They said... your second,

264
00:18:50,481 --> 00:18:54,084
Jody, was 23 days old.

265
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,023
The autopsy showed no
signs of trauma, so...

266
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,827
SIDs.

267
00:19:04,996 --> 00:19:08,531
I lost one myself, Charmaine.

268
00:19:12,503 --> 00:19:15,071
I lost a marriage, too.

269
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:25,081
Now your third,

270
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:28,184
and you had him last year.

271
00:19:28,218 --> 00:19:31,588
Jesus, lady, you ever hear
of a fuckin' condom?

272
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:34,558
Birth control's a sin.

273
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:38,094
A child is a wonderful thing.

274
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:57,748
A child is wonderful.

275
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:03,119
You see, sometimes people...

276
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:06,156
mistake a child as an answer

277
00:20:06,223 --> 00:20:08,158
for something,

278
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:11,828
you know, like a way
to change their story.

279
00:20:13,764 --> 00:20:18,168
Charmaine, have you ever
heard of something called...

280
00:20:18,202 --> 00:20:21,304
Munchausen by Proxy?

281
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,475
No.

282
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:33,683
At exactly 4:49 AM,

283
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:36,420
the sleep apnea monitor that
was hooked up to your child

284
00:20:36,454 --> 00:20:39,022
was unplugged...

285
00:20:39,089 --> 00:20:42,258
for 36 minutes.

286
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:44,961
Then it was plugged back
in, and by that time,

287
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:48,131
the child's vitals
had flat-lined.

288
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:53,803
Charmaine, I need you

289
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:56,339
to talk to me
about some things.

290
00:20:56,373 --> 00:20:58,307
OK?

291
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:00,343
OK.

292
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:13,256
How's it going?

293
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:16,392
He's getting it.

294
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:22,532
You should sign that.

295
00:21:24,602 --> 00:21:26,936
The newspapers

296
00:21:26,971 --> 00:21:30,440
are gonna be tough on you...

297
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:34,944
and prison is
very... very hard

298
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:38,114
on people who hurt kids.

299
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:43,119
If you get the opportunity,
you should kill yourself.

300
00:21:46,023 --> 00:21:47,991
What?

301
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:54,130
What? Please.

302
00:21:57,034 --> 00:21:59,135
Oh, just-- wait.

303
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:12,482
Jesus.

304
00:22:12,517 --> 00:22:14,951
This evil bitch.

305
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,887
I called Pennsylvania,
tried to get homicides

306
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:19,823
on the first two
kids, but looks like

307
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:21,791
we may only have the one.

308
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:24,360
- Well, it's still life.
- Yeah.

309
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:26,362
Good job.

310
00:22:26,396 --> 00:22:27,998
Listen, Marty,

311
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:30,333
type that up for me, will ya?

312
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:33,336
Excuse me?
You got somewhere to be?

313
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,805
This confession is,
like, 40 pages.

314
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:37,807
What, and you got somewhere to be?
Come on, man.

315
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:40,510
You want me to tie your
shoes for you, too?

316
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:44,914
Hey.

317
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:47,717
Hey.

318
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:50,253
I think we
actually need your signature

319
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,455
on the third page,
if you have it.

320
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:54,891
The fuck's with
the attitude, huh?

321
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:57,327
Like my time's less than yours?

322
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:59,395
Oh, you got things
to do, Marty?

323
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:01,965
Need to go home to the
family, play with the kids?

324
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,900
Don't get up my ass

325
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:06,135
- just 'cause you ain't gettin' any.
- Oh.

326
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,104
You should have held on
to your woman.

327
00:23:08,139 --> 00:23:10,140
Gettin' laid was good for you.

328
00:23:10,174 --> 00:23:11,640
Goddamn.

329
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:13,743
You moron.

330
00:23:13,811 --> 00:23:16,179
Goddamn.

331
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:18,181
You, these people, this place.

332
00:23:18,215 --> 00:23:20,183
It's like you eat
your fuckin' young

333
00:23:20,217 --> 00:23:22,185
and that's all just fine
as long as you got

334
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:24,688
something to salute, huh?

335
00:23:24,722 --> 00:23:27,156
What's going on with you, man?

336
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:29,658
I mean, Salter asked about it.

337
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:31,627
Iberia called.

338
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:34,130
You been going around
bothering people,

339
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:36,099
trying to open up old cases.

340
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:38,201
I am working.

341
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:40,570
I have things to do.

342
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:42,606
So type the report, man.

343
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,240
That's how we do.

344
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:46,242
I get people to talk,
you write the stats.

345
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:48,845
It's worked out well
for you so far.

346
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:56,019
I'm the only one
ever took up for you.

347
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:57,988
Ever.

348
00:23:58,022 --> 00:24:01,424
You know what it's like
being your partner, huh?

349
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:03,359
Fuck you.

350
00:24:03,394 --> 00:24:06,429
No, buddy, without me...

351
00:24:06,463 --> 00:24:08,531
there is no you.

352
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,535
So type the fuckin'
report, man.

353
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:23,213
We've had behaviorists
in with her.

354
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:25,148
It's regressive catatonia.

355
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:26,549
Seven years now.

356
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:29,219
If she shows any distress,
responds in any way negatively,

357
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:31,621
- we're gonna have to ask you to leave.
- Of course.

358
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:33,489
- OK.
- I was actually one of the men

359
00:24:33,524 --> 00:24:35,958
who found Kelly at that
place 7 years back.

360
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:37,861
She's right here.

361
00:25:01,852 --> 00:25:03,687
Kelly.

362
00:25:03,721 --> 00:25:07,957
Now, you may not remember, but
you and I met a long time ago.

363
00:25:07,992 --> 00:25:11,494
I want to ask you a
question about those men

364
00:25:11,528 --> 00:25:14,730
that hurt you way back then.

365
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:20,003
Do you remember if there
were more than two?

366
00:25:20,037 --> 00:25:22,972
Was there anyone else?

367
00:25:49,733 --> 00:25:52,735
The man with the scars

368
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:56,205
was the worst.

369
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,141
My Lord.

370
00:25:58,175 --> 00:26:00,276
What scars?

371
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:06,449
The giant.

372
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:12,421
He made me watch

373
00:26:12,456 --> 00:26:14,790
what he did to Billy.

374
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,263
The scars on the giant,
were they-- were they on his face?

375
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:22,265
His face.

376
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:24,734
His face.

377
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:28,104
His face.

378
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:36,345
All right, Rose,
I need-- I need Haldol.

379
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,448
Stat, please...

380
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:55,999
What are you doing, Cohle?

381
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:58,868
Riling up people,
opening old cases.

382
00:26:58,902 --> 00:27:01,304
Iberia Sheriff's talking
jurisdictional complaint.

383
00:27:01,338 --> 00:27:03,406
Something's going on, Major,

384
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,341
along the coast.

385
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:07,343
Women...

386
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:09,412
children disappearing.

387
00:27:09,446 --> 00:27:12,081
Nobody hears about it,
nobody puts them together.

388
00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:14,517
First I'm hearing
about it, Boss.

389
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,552
Puts what together, Cohle?

390
00:27:16,586 --> 00:27:19,922
Someone, maybe more than one,

391
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:21,925
is killing people, Major,

392
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:24,627
and they've been doing it
for a long time.

393
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:27,096
Yeah, you got any bodies?

394
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,098
You got something actually
applies to your job

395
00:27:29,133 --> 00:27:31,100
as a homicide detective?

396
00:27:31,135 --> 00:27:33,102
Know what he did?
Know what he did?

397
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:35,071
Goes and visits Kelly Reider,

398
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:37,006
sent her into a screaming fit.

399
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,575
Look, either we don't find
them or they don't get connected.

400
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,544
I don't know which,

401
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,546
and I can't decide
if it's a cover-up

402
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,549
or the garden-variety
incompetence here.

403
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,052
I mean, it has to do
with those boys we got

404
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,354
in '95, the Dora Lange killing.

405
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:53,389
We didn't get them all.

406
00:27:53,424 --> 00:27:54,924
You're building
something in your head.

407
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:57,126
Women, then children.

408
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,595
Now they're getting no press,

409
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,898
the way things in the
bayou get no press.

410
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,767
And it's happening
in the same area

411
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:06,870
where that Voudon shit
goes down,

412
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:09,906
and it's happening in the same area
where those schools were set up.

413
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,874
What the fuck schools
you talking about?

414
00:28:11,908 --> 00:28:15,411
Tuition reimbursement programs
for rural and Christian schools

415
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:17,513
founded by Billy Lee Tuttle.

416
00:28:17,548 --> 00:28:19,482
Yeah.
Think about it.

417
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:23,018
Back in '95, why was he so fired
up to get his ass down here?

418
00:28:23,053 --> 00:28:25,988
He comes barging in
with his task force.

419
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:29,559
Fuck, before we even got started
on the case, he took it over.

420
00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:31,094
Why?

421
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,596
'Cause he recognized
something in it.

422
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,098
We're in a muddy
swamp here, man.

423
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:39,568
The alligators are
swimming around us,

424
00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:43,206
and we don't even know whether
they're there. You know why?

425
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,708
'Cause we don't see 'em.

426
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:48,243
I caught
zero logic in all that.

427
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:49,578
And that last bit?

428
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:51,013
Pure gibberish.

429
00:28:51,081 --> 00:28:53,382
How about we track
all the missing persons

430
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:55,851
within 10 miles
of every Walmart, huh?

431
00:28:55,886 --> 00:28:58,388
Right along the I-10. Why don't
we go after Sam Walmart?

432
00:28:58,422 --> 00:29:00,924
I'm fixing to pull you
for mental exhaustion, man.

433
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:02,858
You want to stay on?

434
00:29:02,892 --> 00:29:06,429
Do not ever, ever say that
to anyone in State again.

435
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:08,564
Sure.

436
00:29:09,934 --> 00:29:12,702
That's some fuckin' nerve
you got, buddy.

437
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:16,739
You need to take a few steps
back, Rust, right now.

438
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:18,708
All right. Hey.

439
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:20,876
No more visiting
victims' families.

440
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,878
You will stop trying
to turn missing persons

441
00:29:22,913 --> 00:29:25,048
into homicides, as you
do not have any bodies.

442
00:29:25,082 --> 00:29:27,350
That's a direct fuckin'
order, you hear me?

443
00:29:27,384 --> 00:29:31,587
You do anything else, I'll have you on
insubordination, and I will suspend you.

444
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:33,055
Please, take some time.

445
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:34,757
Go on one of them
fishing tours or something.

446
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,859
All right?
Get yourself together.

447
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:55,178
And a little
less than two years ago,

448
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:58,448
Tuttle overdosed.
Accidentally, supposed.

449
00:29:58,482 --> 00:29:59,915
You mentioned that already.

450
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:01,417
Couple weeks before he died,

451
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:03,386
Tuttle's house in
Shreveport was broken into.

452
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,588
Found out his Baton
Rouge one was, too.

453
00:30:05,656 --> 00:30:07,557
Wasn't reported.

454
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:09,525
So?

455
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,894
So your man gets a
hard-on for Tuttle.

456
00:30:11,928 --> 00:30:13,829
Man's house gets broken
into right after Cohle

457
00:30:13,863 --> 00:30:15,330
turns back up in the state.

458
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:17,733
What's he been
doing since, here?

459
00:30:17,768 --> 00:30:20,403
Drinking, bartending?

460
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:21,737
Dude with a mind
like that, you think

461
00:30:21,772 --> 00:30:23,239
that's all he get up to?

462
00:30:23,273 --> 00:30:26,809
Marty, he'd
never went anywhere.

463
00:30:26,843 --> 00:30:28,744
He never left.

464
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:31,847
He's been right here doing
bad things a long time.

465
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:39,688
Hey, hey, hey.
Hold up now.

466
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:42,625
Been in this room
a long time, gentlemen.

467
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:46,596
Whatever Rust is

468
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,098
or was or became...

469
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:52,135
don't call me again.

470
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:53,603
I won't help you.

471
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:55,904
We're trying
to help him, Marty.

472
00:31:21,364 --> 00:31:23,366
Hey, did you have a good day?

473
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,667
Mm-hmm.

474
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:25,734
Well, why don't you get
that bathroom cleaned

475
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:28,271
finally, huh, get all
the toothpaste up?

476
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:30,405
Thanks.

477
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:07,876
Marty, I didn't know
you were home.

478
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:09,879
Oh, yeah, I'm just cleaning up.

479
00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:12,047
Be out in a sec.

480
00:32:15,952 --> 00:32:18,387
I'll heat up something.

481
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,856
Hey, those flowers
came in nice.

482
00:32:20,891 --> 00:32:24,560
You were right. They really
brighten up the yard.

483
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:30,866
Hey,

484
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:34,203
I was thinking we're
due for a date night,

485
00:32:34,238 --> 00:32:36,872
don't you think, you and me?

486
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:40,243
I want to dress up and go

487
00:32:40,277 --> 00:32:42,244
for a nice dinner,

488
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:44,179
the movies.

489
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:47,717
Yeah? Does that
sound good?

490
00:32:50,253 --> 00:32:52,021
Honey?

491
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:53,889
Sure.

492
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:04,933
Ah.

493
00:33:11,842 --> 00:33:14,309
Oh. Thanks, hon.

494
00:33:14,344 --> 00:33:15,945
Nice.

495
00:33:21,818 --> 00:33:25,954
So, is my eldest still
offended by my presence?

496
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:29,425
Huh?

497
00:33:31,628 --> 00:33:34,063
Yeah, I don't mind.

498
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:38,033
I'm happy just to sit here with
3 beautiful women watching...

499
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:40,570
What is this?

500
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:43,239
"Dumb Blondes
in Cracker Country"?

501
00:33:54,217 --> 00:33:56,084
Hey, hon?

502
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,754
Do me a favor, find the game?

503
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:03,191
Here you go.

504
00:34:03,226 --> 00:34:05,194
I have to study.

505
00:34:05,228 --> 00:34:07,330
Good girl.

506
00:34:10,234 --> 00:34:14,169
Rolls right onto
victory lane into Daytona USA.

507
00:34:17,173 --> 00:34:20,576
Davis with the steal.
Pops it in to Hudson.

508
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:24,479
Hudson trying to move the ball down
the court, and a foul on Flowers.

509
00:34:26,382 --> 00:34:28,351
What?

510
00:34:28,385 --> 00:34:30,485
Nothing.

511
00:34:31,855 --> 00:34:34,857
Now, this pasta is great.

512
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:36,659
Thanks.

513
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:38,627
You're welcome.

514
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:44,567
I love you.

515
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:48,003
Thank you.

516
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:53,108
You turn it down some, please?

517
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:55,611
Sure, hon.

518
00:34:55,646 --> 00:34:58,113
Ahem.

519
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,718
How's that?

520
00:35:04,554 --> 00:35:07,122
We were talking once

521
00:35:07,157 --> 00:35:09,591
about growing up parents.

522
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:13,095
I said something about
forgiveness, and he said

523
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:17,099
that there was no such thing
as forgiveness...

524
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:19,568
that people just have
short memories.

525
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:22,571
You think Cohle
was wrong about that?

526
00:35:22,606 --> 00:35:24,673
Forgiveness?

527
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,909
Less and less.

528
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,396
Hi.

529
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:55,738
Get you a drink, Miss?

530
00:35:55,772 --> 00:35:58,240
Thank you.
Uh, sure.

531
00:35:58,274 --> 00:36:01,344
A vodka Martini, extra dirty.

532
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:04,613
Margaret.

533
00:36:04,648 --> 00:36:06,581
Bruce. Hi.

534
00:36:06,616 --> 00:36:08,216
Hi.

535
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:15,090
So you, uh, waiting
for someone?

536
00:36:15,125 --> 00:36:16,726
No.

537
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,998
You and, uh,
Marty split prior, right?

538
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:25,835
In '95?

539
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:30,238
Are either of you married?

540
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:31,707
- Got an ex.
- Mmm.

541
00:36:31,742 --> 00:36:33,175
Still on the first.

542
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:36,344
It's difficult to admit defeat.

543
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:40,182
Marty quit drinking,

544
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:42,684
found religion for a while.

545
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:45,220
I didn't love that.

546
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:47,623
To be honest,
I preferred him before;

547
00:36:47,657 --> 00:36:49,057
he had a sense of humor then.

548
00:36:49,092 --> 00:36:53,128
But we stayed together 7 more
years, some of it pretty good.

549
00:36:53,162 --> 00:36:54,629
2002?

550
00:36:54,664 --> 00:36:57,099
Cohle's bad year, too.

551
00:36:57,133 --> 00:37:01,103
Rust was an intense man,
but he had integrity.

552
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:03,605
He was responsible.

553
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:07,276
Not a lot of responsible
people in the world.

554
00:37:14,584 --> 00:37:16,552
Reverend, thanks for taking

555
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:18,553
the time to see me
on such short notice.

556
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:21,556
Of course, Detective, please.

557
00:37:21,591 --> 00:37:25,060
It's a very
interesting... building.

558
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:28,397
This was the first.
Built it in 1980.

559
00:37:28,432 --> 00:37:31,333
The rest of the campus
grew around it.

560
00:37:31,367 --> 00:37:34,236
Now, I remembered
you, of course.

561
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:36,872
People of this state
owe you a great deal.

562
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:40,142
Not as much as they owe you.

563
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,977
Charitable organizations,

564
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:43,846
education initiatives.

565
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,348
Thank you. We're very
proud of our ministries.

566
00:37:46,382 --> 00:37:49,885
I don't do as much
preaching as I used to,

567
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,855
but the legacy program
is more my focus now,

568
00:37:52,889 --> 00:37:57,359
the things like the
State Policemen's Charity-- but...

569
00:37:57,393 --> 00:37:59,394
what did you want
to talk about, son?

570
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:02,364
The Wellspring program,

571
00:38:02,398 --> 00:38:04,900
mid-eighties through
the early nineties.

572
00:38:04,935 --> 00:38:06,534
You remember that?

573
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:08,671
Well, of course
I remember, yeah.

574
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:12,007
I'm trying to locate
old personnel,

575
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:15,010
faculty, but I'm having a little
bit of trouble acquiring names.

576
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:18,546
Well, the program was shut down
officially, you know, maybe 10 years ago.

577
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:20,549
I never had much ground
contact with it,

578
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:23,052
but it involved a number
of private schools--

579
00:38:23,086 --> 00:38:25,020
enterprises,
you understand--

580
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:28,557
that would adopt our standard
of curriculum and, in return,

581
00:38:28,592 --> 00:38:30,558
receive tuition reimbursement

582
00:38:30,593 --> 00:38:32,094
for underprivileged students.

583
00:38:32,128 --> 00:38:34,663
You got any files,

584
00:38:34,698 --> 00:38:36,999
any list of faculty?

585
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:40,002
Well, that's what I'm getting at, is
that these were private institutions,

586
00:38:40,036 --> 00:38:43,238
so you'd have to track down their
administrators, I believe.

587
00:38:43,273 --> 00:38:44,673
That's the thing.

588
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,710
See, all the schools
dissolved with the program,

589
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,212
and I'm trying
to find some tax info,

590
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:52,715
but there were
religious exemptions.

591
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:55,384
Well, there's our
archives, of course.

592
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:57,385
Now, we did lose
a lot of files,

593
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,855
had some flooding of one
of the sub-floors.

594
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,858
But, you know, I think I should
put you together with one

595
00:39:03,893 --> 00:39:06,828
of our clerical workers and see if
they can't help you find something.

596
00:39:06,862 --> 00:39:10,833
Thank you. Listen,
before you do that...

597
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:15,270
former deacon of yours,
Austin Farrar.

598
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,210
That was very,
very unfortunate.

599
00:39:21,244 --> 00:39:23,211
Yet he was dismissed.

600
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:25,514
Evidence had accrued.

601
00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:27,849
It became apparent
that Austin had

602
00:39:27,883 --> 00:39:31,353
implemented
certain... funds.

603
00:39:31,387 --> 00:39:33,855
Well, "Embezzling" is the word.

604
00:39:33,889 --> 00:39:36,358
We elected to handle it
internally,

605
00:39:36,392 --> 00:39:39,027
rather than pursuing
formal charges.

606
00:39:39,062 --> 00:39:42,697
And then he had
his... accident.

607
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:46,569
I'd heard he had taken it hard,

608
00:39:46,603 --> 00:39:48,703
drinking.

609
00:39:50,106 --> 00:39:54,076
I've seen more souls lost
down a bottle than any pit.

610
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,545
At the same time,

611
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,548
it's hard to trust a man
who can't trust himself

612
00:39:59,582 --> 00:40:02,217
with a beer, don't you think?

613
00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:04,820
Hmm.

614
00:40:04,854 --> 00:40:07,823
But what's this
all about now? Um...

615
00:40:07,857 --> 00:40:10,325
Wellspring program,

616
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,827
Austin Farrar?

617
00:40:11,861 --> 00:40:13,796
Dead women and children.

618
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:19,334
Terrible.

619
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:21,803
That's terrible.

620
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,773
How is that what
you're working on?

621
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:29,344
Oh, I can't say anything about
it at this point, Reverend.

622
00:40:31,214 --> 00:40:34,349
I'd like to set you up
with a clerk.

623
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:40,055
You can look at, uh,

624
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:43,358
whatever information
we still have

625
00:40:43,393 --> 00:40:45,994
from Wellspring.

626
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:53,335
Why'd the Wellspring program
shut down, Reverend?

627
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:56,005
It couldn't sustain its costs.

628
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:58,707
The whole idea was to
provide an alternative

629
00:40:58,742 --> 00:41:01,710
to the kind of secular,
globalized education

630
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:04,212
that our public schools
were promoting.

631
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:07,215
When we get the school
voucher program instituted,

632
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:09,684
we'll reintroduce the idea.

633
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:13,255
People should have a choice in
education, like anything else.

634
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:14,723
Hmm.

635
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:17,525
Steve, would you show
the detective

636
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,229
to our old archives
for outside ministries?

637
00:41:20,263 --> 00:41:22,197
- Yes, sir.
- I'll call ahead.

638
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:23,866
I'm gonna come back for that.

639
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,701
Reverend, thank you
for your time today.

640
00:41:28,071 --> 00:41:30,705
Godspeed, Detective.

641
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,544
You'll be in my thoughts.

642
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:41,250
Oh, just the one more time.

643
00:41:41,284 --> 00:41:43,752
I just need it-- I just
need it one more time.

644
00:41:43,787 --> 00:41:47,289
Beth, if you knew
the day I just had--

645
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:52,427
Oh, then tell me about it.
I want to hear about it.

646
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,298
Oh...

647
00:41:56,332 --> 00:41:58,767
no, you do not.

648
00:41:58,802 --> 00:42:02,771
I really wanted to see you.

649
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:05,774
I've been thinking
about something all week.

650
00:42:05,808 --> 00:42:08,777
Don't.
Ever since last time.

651
00:42:08,811 --> 00:42:11,246
Don't, OK?
I just--

652
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:14,449
Haven't been able to think of
anything else, tell you the truth.

653
00:42:14,483 --> 00:42:16,451
Ohh...

654
00:42:16,486 --> 00:42:18,953
like what?

655
00:42:18,988 --> 00:42:22,157
I've been thinking.

656
00:42:23,592 --> 00:42:26,528
I think...

657
00:42:26,562 --> 00:42:29,131
I want you to fuck me
in my ass.

658
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:32,467
Uh, Beth.

659
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:34,970
I've never done that
before, but

660
00:42:35,004 --> 00:42:37,539
I think I want you
to do it to me.

661
00:42:37,573 --> 00:42:39,574
I want you to feel better.

662
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:43,245
You out
of your goddamn mind, hmm?

663
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:46,214
What'd I tell you?

664
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:48,716
You're fuckin'
unbelievable, boy.

665
00:42:48,751 --> 00:42:50,185
You know about this?

666
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,455
Uh, I'm not sure what
we're talking about here.

667
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:55,423
Your partner here,
he braced Billy Lee Tuttle.

668
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:57,459
Oh, "Braced"?
Are you fucking kidding me?

669
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:58,994
It was a friendly conversation.

670
00:42:59,028 --> 00:43:00,662
Hey, dipshit,

671
00:43:00,696 --> 00:43:03,865
you don't get to decide what
kind of conversation it was.

672
00:43:03,899 --> 00:43:05,533
Why'd you talk
to Billy Lee Tut--

673
00:43:05,568 --> 00:43:07,569
And you, look at--
you look like you haven't seen

674
00:43:07,603 --> 00:43:09,671
your own bed
in a couple days, huh?

675
00:43:09,705 --> 00:43:11,606
Yeah? The fuck is wrong
with you two?

676
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,542
Ahem.
Well, I-- I can't speak for Rust,

677
00:43:14,577 --> 00:43:16,511
but I got the flu.

678
00:43:16,546 --> 00:43:18,513
I didn't know
that was going around.

679
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:20,515
Look, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

680
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:22,517
If he was pissed off after
the conversation we had,

681
00:43:22,552 --> 00:43:24,019
then I am on
to fucking something.

682
00:43:24,053 --> 00:43:25,520
Shut the fuck up.
I told you.

683
00:43:25,555 --> 00:43:26,989
I fuckin' told you!

684
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:29,057
And human tampon here heard me.

685
00:43:29,092 --> 00:43:31,059
Badge and gun, Cohle.
You're suspended.

686
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:32,560
One month without pay.

687
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:34,563
Repeated rank insubordination,

688
00:43:34,597 --> 00:43:36,498
misallocation
departmental resources.

689
00:43:36,532 --> 00:43:37,966
- Come on.
- Leroy.

690
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:39,134
Come on, that's over the top.

691
00:43:39,168 --> 00:43:41,703
Don't you fuckin' Leroy me!
I told you both!

692
00:43:41,737 --> 00:43:44,406
Cut the shit!
It's done.

693
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,541
Badge and gun, Cohle.

694
00:43:49,913 --> 00:43:52,714
Oh, and, uh, before
your official reinstatement,

695
00:43:52,748 --> 00:43:55,417
you have 30 hours mandated
departmental counseling.

696
00:43:55,484 --> 00:43:56,851
You fuckin' serious?

697
00:43:56,886 --> 00:43:57,885
This guy, right?

698
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,388
I got to kick you
in the fuckin' head.

699
00:43:59,422 --> 00:44:01,824
I'm the person least
in need of counseling

700
00:44:01,858 --> 00:44:03,791
in this entire fuckin' state.

701
00:44:03,826 --> 00:44:05,994
You ain't acting
right, you don't sound right.

702
00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:08,863
You're up my ass,
and you were warned.

703
00:44:46,569 --> 00:44:48,036
What?

704
00:44:48,071 --> 00:44:50,672
He's doing it again.

705
00:44:52,074 --> 00:44:54,509
He's been doing it.

706
00:44:54,544 --> 00:44:57,679
I can't live with it.

707
00:45:03,852 --> 00:45:05,920
I can't live with it.

708
00:45:10,826 --> 00:45:12,794
I can't deal with it,

709
00:45:12,828 --> 00:45:14,929
not again.

710
00:45:16,832 --> 00:45:19,301
Did you know?

711
00:45:19,335 --> 00:45:22,036
Did you know?

712
00:45:23,939 --> 00:45:26,041
No.

713
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:48,763
What are you doing in here?

714
00:45:48,797 --> 00:45:51,166
What happened?

715
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,735
I'm off the job.

716
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:01,576
That's not what I mean.

717
00:46:09,985 --> 00:46:12,587
You can't live like this.

718
00:46:14,723 --> 00:46:16,691
You know, people
that give me advice,

719
00:46:16,726 --> 00:46:18,226
I reckon they're talking
to themselves.

720
00:46:18,261 --> 00:46:20,162
What are you doing?

721
00:46:20,196 --> 00:46:23,532
Some people, no matter where
they look, they see themselves.

722
00:46:36,412 --> 00:46:39,147
Be honest...

723
00:46:39,182 --> 00:46:41,283
with me now.

724
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:10,204
What the fuck are you
doing here?

725
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,806
Huh?

726
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:15,176
I'm sorry.

727
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:17,712
You know...

728
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:20,215
it wasn't you.

729
00:48:20,249 --> 00:48:22,650
Really. I...

730
00:48:22,685 --> 00:48:26,121
I wasn't even sure
I could do it,

731
00:48:26,155 --> 00:48:28,957
- 'cause seventeen years is a long time.
- Huh?

732
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:30,792
You know...

733
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:33,295
I almost went with a...

734
00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:36,298
with a stranger, a bar.

735
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:38,300
I'm sorry, Rust.

736
00:48:38,334 --> 00:48:42,470
He'll have
to go, you see, because this

737
00:48:42,505 --> 00:48:44,038
he won't live with.

738
00:48:44,073 --> 00:48:45,573
Get the fuck out of here.

739
00:48:45,608 --> 00:48:47,576
This...

740
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,043
You get the fuck--

741
00:48:49,077 --> 00:48:50,545
This will hurt him.

742
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,046
Get the fuck out
of here right now.

743
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,548
I'm sorry, but thank you.

744
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:55,717
You get the fuck out of here.

745
00:48:57,052 --> 00:49:00,221
- I'm--
- Get the fuck out of here!

746
00:49:09,264 --> 00:49:12,934
Do you know what was going
on with Cohle around that time?

747
00:49:14,837 --> 00:49:16,771
No.

748
00:49:16,805 --> 00:49:19,273
I knew that he got suspended

749
00:49:19,308 --> 00:49:21,209
and that he quit

750
00:49:21,243 --> 00:49:24,312
after he and Marty had his...

751
00:49:24,347 --> 00:49:26,114
they had their thing.

752
00:49:26,149 --> 00:49:27,849
That's it.

753
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:30,952
So your split with Marty...

754
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:34,221
that had nothing
to do with Cohle?

755
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:37,525
No.

756
00:50:01,684 --> 00:50:03,217
Hey, hon.

757
00:50:09,859 --> 00:50:11,760
Hi, Marty.

758
00:50:11,794 --> 00:50:14,262
How you doing?

759
00:50:14,297 --> 00:50:15,897
Sit down.

760
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:18,867
OK.

761
00:50:20,969 --> 00:50:23,104
I have to tell you something.

762
00:50:29,044 --> 00:50:32,314
I saw the pictures
on your phone.

763
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:35,784
"B"?

764
00:50:35,818 --> 00:50:37,919
- Now, honey--
- Nice ass, Marty.

765
00:50:37,953 --> 00:50:39,921
- No, I--
- I was maybe always a little

766
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:41,690
- too skinny for you.
- No.

767
00:50:41,724 --> 00:50:43,758
I cannot help it if some
crazy bitch sent--

768
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:45,927
I slept with someone.

769
00:50:52,334 --> 00:50:54,436
And you know him.

770
00:50:55,838 --> 00:50:57,939
You're close.

771
00:51:01,777 --> 00:51:03,745
Who?

772
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:05,714
It was Rust.

773
00:51:05,748 --> 00:51:08,383
I fucked your partner Rust.

774
00:51:13,588 --> 00:51:15,523
Oh.

775
00:51:15,558 --> 00:51:17,492
Now, what-- what
are you saying?

776
00:51:17,526 --> 00:51:20,562
What-- what are you--
what the fuck are you saying to me?

777
00:51:20,596 --> 00:51:22,697
I already told you.

778
00:51:27,302 --> 00:51:28,736
You fucking whore.

779
00:51:28,771 --> 00:51:30,738
You don't know the half of it.

780
00:51:30,773 --> 00:51:32,807
To tell you the truth,
I haven't been fucked

781
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:34,842
like that since
before the girls.

782
00:51:41,617 --> 00:51:43,084
Do it.

783
00:51:43,118 --> 00:51:44,719
Do it!

784
00:51:46,154 --> 00:51:49,356
At least I'll have something
to explain to your daughters.

785
00:51:51,226 --> 00:51:53,862
Get your fucking hands off me.

786
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,865
Coward.

787
00:52:23,726 --> 00:52:25,659
Cohle's outside.

788
00:52:25,694 --> 00:52:28,329
Does he know he's suspended?

789
00:52:55,057 --> 00:52:57,158
I was coming for
my files, Marty.

790
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:00,795
Hey, hey, hey!

791
00:53:00,829 --> 00:53:02,764
Whoa!

792
00:53:02,798 --> 00:53:05,299
Come on, guys, stop this shit.

793
00:53:05,334 --> 00:53:07,301
Come on, Marty.

794
00:53:08,471 --> 00:53:10,437
Come on, swing, Marty!

795
00:53:10,472 --> 00:53:12,073
You're gettin' your ass kicked!

796
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:13,607
Oh, my God.

797
00:53:13,642 --> 00:53:15,142
Get Salter.
Get Salter!

798
00:53:15,177 --> 00:53:17,679
Hurry up! Stop them!

799
00:53:17,713 --> 00:53:19,346
Hey!

800
00:53:19,381 --> 00:53:20,815
Stop!

801
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:21,983
Oh!

802
00:53:22,017 --> 00:53:24,285
Stay down, Marty.
Come on now.

803
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:25,853
Don't do it!
Hop up!

804
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:27,321
Get up, get up!
Work it out.

805
00:53:27,356 --> 00:53:28,923
- Calm down, Marty.
- All right, that's enough now.

806
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,427
Hey!

807
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:33,761
All right, back off!

808
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:35,797
- Come on! Come on! Get him out of here!
- Come on, Hart!

809
00:53:35,831 --> 00:53:37,131
Get him the fuck out of here!

810
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:38,332
Fuck you!

811
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:40,234
- Calm down, Marty!
- Cohle!

812
00:53:40,268 --> 00:53:42,236
You better calm
your shit right now!

813
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:44,205
Get inside!

814
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:46,207
You standing around
watching this shit?!

815
00:53:46,241 --> 00:53:47,942
Get the fuck inside!

816
00:53:47,977 --> 00:53:49,310
I'm gonna
kill you, motherfucker!

817
00:53:49,344 --> 00:53:50,412
Get him inside.

818
00:53:50,446 --> 00:53:51,545
We ain't done here!

819
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,715
- Get him inside.
- We ain't done here!

820
00:53:53,749 --> 00:53:55,716
Stop this shit.

821
00:53:57,185 --> 00:53:59,721
I'm gonna need some
fuckin' detail here, you two.

822
00:53:59,755 --> 00:54:02,857
It's a personal
matter between us, Boss.

823
00:54:02,892 --> 00:54:05,827
Is there anybody
pressin' charges?

824
00:54:05,861 --> 00:54:07,461
Not me.

825
00:54:08,831 --> 00:54:11,466
You want
to say anything, Cohle?

826
00:54:12,868 --> 00:54:14,302
No.

827
00:54:14,336 --> 00:54:15,937
This man right here

828
00:54:15,971 --> 00:54:17,939
is the only pal you had,

829
00:54:17,973 --> 00:54:19,406
you understand that?

830
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:22,076
Fuck him.
I ain't his pal.

831
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,448
I quit.

832
00:54:26,482 --> 00:54:28,016
You serious?

833
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,551
I'll send you a letter.
Yeah, fuck this.

834
00:54:30,585 --> 00:54:32,687
Fuck this world, man.

835
00:54:34,123 --> 00:54:36,190
Nice hook, Marty.

836
00:54:42,064 --> 00:54:44,499
You're not gonna go
into this, huh? Really?

837
00:54:46,368 --> 00:54:49,370
You two fucked each
other up pretty good.

838
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:51,505
No shit.

839
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,350
What about when
he quit? Any idea why?

840
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:06,287
Maybe it was
old stuff between them...

841
00:55:06,321 --> 00:55:09,957
the way they
always rubbed wrong.

842
00:55:09,992 --> 00:55:12,860
I never learned
what it was about.

843
00:56:06,749 --> 00:56:08,683
Marty.

844
00:56:08,717 --> 00:56:10,684
Rust.

845
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:12,820
Long time.

846
00:56:14,222 --> 00:56:16,690
Long time.

847
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:19,260
Change your hair?

848
00:56:19,294 --> 00:56:22,296
Thought maybe we should talk.

849
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:24,298
Yeah?

850
00:56:24,332 --> 00:56:26,434
Buy you a beer?

851
00:56:29,905 --> 00:56:32,607
Sure. I'll follow you.

852
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:44,552
Actually, why don't you
buy me a beer?

853
