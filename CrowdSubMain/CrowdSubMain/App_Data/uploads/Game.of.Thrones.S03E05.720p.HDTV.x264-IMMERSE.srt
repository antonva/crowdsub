<i>The Tyrells are a problem.</i>

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,794
The Tyrells helped us
defeat Stannis Baratheon.

3
00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:06,262
You must see Highgarden.

4
00:00:06,296 --> 00:00:08,698
I don't think the queen
would let me leave King's Landing.

5
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:10,633
Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.

6
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:14,306
And if you were
to marry Loras...

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,943
You must give yourself
to the Lord of Light.

8
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:19,481
- I have a wife.
- She's shut away in a tower.

9
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:22,684
And she's given you no sons,
only stillborns.

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,556
I lost one son to the Kingslayer,
strangled with a chain.

11
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,158
I grieve for
your sons, my lord.

12
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:30,460
I don't want your grief.
I want my vengeance.

13
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:37,233
Do that again
and I'll take your other hand.

14
00:00:37,268 --> 00:00:39,504
- What value was the mill?
- I seized an opportunity.

15
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:42,707
<i>We took hostages--</i>
<i>Willem Lannister, Martyn Lannister.</i>

16
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:45,337
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

17
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:47,368
I'm not your enemy.

18
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:48,544
This woman is evil!

19
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:50,526
Take him to the dungeon
and lock him in a cell.

20
00:00:50,803 --> 00:00:52,137
You want to
assassinate a girl?

21
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:55,106
- Based on whose information?
<i>- Ser Jorah Mormont.</i>

22
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,408
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

23
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:59,744
You bring us the whispers
of a traitor.

24
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:02,047
Beric Dondarrion?
If you mean to murder me,

25
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:03,850
then bloody well
get on with it.

26
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:06,252
You'll die soon enough,
but it won't be murder.

27
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:08,855
I sentence you
to trial by combat.

28
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:12,992
Is it done, then?

But not today.

62
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:22,050
Orell says there are crows
patrolling on the Wall.

63
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:24,652
Tell me what you know.

64
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:26,420
There are four
to a patrol--

65
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:28,322
two builders to check
for structural damage,

66
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:29,790
two rangers to watch
for enemies.

67
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,892
How often do these
patrols go out?

68
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:34,828
It varies.

69
00:07:34,862 --> 00:07:37,498
If I knew where on the Wall we
were heading, I could tell you.

70
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:40,001
You'd like to know that.

71
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,506
There are 19 castles
guarding the Wall.

72
00:07:45,975 --> 00:07:48,343
How many are manned?

73
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:50,713
Three.

74
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:53,416
You sure of that?

75
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:56,686
Which three?

76
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,857
Castle Black.

77
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:02,725
Aye, Castle Black.

78
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,860
Everyone knows
Castle Black.

79
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:06,895
Which others?

80
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:14,503
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea

81
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:17,439
and the Shadow Tower.

82
00:08:19,508 --> 00:08:21,676
How many men remain
in Castle Black?

83
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,445
- 1,000.
- Liar.

84
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:27,616
What happens to your eagle
after I kill you?

85
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,185
Does he drift away like a
kite with his strings cut

86
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,520
or does he just flop
dead to the ground?

87
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,055
He's no crow.

88
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,490
Just 'cause you want him inside
you don't make him one of us.

89
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,994
I'm not afraid of you.

90
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:47,168
I like you, boy.

91
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:50,105
But if you lie to me,

92
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:53,375
I'll pull your guts out
through your throat.

93
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:57,912
1,000 men.

94
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:05,787
We'll find out soon enough.

95
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:14,362
I don't need you
to protect me.

96
00:09:14,397 --> 00:09:15,797
Of course you do.

97
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:18,666
Who stopped Rattleshirt
when he was about to cut your throat?

98
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:21,502
Who vouched for you
with Mance?

99
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:23,571
It seems
you owe me a debt.

100
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,442
- Give it back.
- Well, I stole it.

101
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:31,178
It's mine.
If you want it, come steal it back.

102
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:34,982
<i>Ygritte!</i>

103
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:38,085
<i>Ygritte!</i>

104
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,358
Ygritte!
Seven hells.

105
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,527
<i>Ygritte!</i>

106
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:52,434
Is Orell right?

107
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,436
Are you still a crow?

108
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:59,207
It's time you
proved yourself.

109
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:00,976
Ygritte.

110
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,612
You swore some vows.

111
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:05,547
I want you to break 'em.

112
00:10:08,451 --> 00:10:10,818
I want you to see me.

113
00:10:13,355 --> 00:10:15,656
All of me.

114
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:31,105
We shouldn't.

115
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:35,376
We should.

116
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:57,331
Why are you
still dressed?

117
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,867
You know nothing,
Jon Sno--

118
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:16,917
That thing you did

119
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:18,919
with your mouth--

120
00:11:20,455 --> 00:11:23,291
is that what lords
do to their ladies in the South?

121
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:25,460
I don't know.

122
00:11:25,494 --> 00:11:27,262
I just wanted to kiss
you there is all.

123
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,764
Hmm.

124
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:30,499
You seemed to like it.

125
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,935
Aye, I liked it some.

126
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,537
Who taught you that?

127
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:37,440
There's been no one else.
Only you.

128
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:39,375
A maid.

129
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,244
You were a maid.

130
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,180
I was a man
of the Night's Watch.

131
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:48,117
How about you?
Were you a maid?

132
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:49,552
What do you think?

133
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:52,454
- Who was he?
- Just a boy.

134
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:55,090
He came trading
with his brothers.

135
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:58,293
He had red hair like me.
Kissed by fire.

136
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:00,228
But...

137
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:02,764
he was weak.

138
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,499
Not like you.

139
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:06,468
That was the first one.

140
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:08,471
Then there was
this Thenn boy.

141
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:11,941
Spoke no Common, but gods,
he was built like a mammoth.

142
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:15,144
Yeah, thanks.
I think I've heard enough.

143
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:19,782
We'd best get back.

144
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:22,185
Tormund--

145
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:26,523
I'm not done
with you yet.

146
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:35,965
How long's it been
since you had a bath?

147
00:12:51,648 --> 00:12:53,616
Let's not go back.

148
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:57,520
Let's stay here
a while longer.

149
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:03,192
I don't ever want
to leave this cave, Jon Snow.

150
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:07,362
Not ever.

151
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,409
<i>I want my gold.</i>

152
00:13:19,443 --> 00:13:20,877
It says it clearly
right there on that note

153
00:13:20,912 --> 00:13:22,479
you'll be repaid in full
when the war is over.

154
00:13:22,513 --> 00:13:24,848
Piss on that!
You're nothing but thieves.

155
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:27,083
We're outlaws.
Outlaws steal.

156
00:13:27,117 --> 00:13:28,618
You're lucky
we didn't kill you.

157
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:29,619
Come try it, archer.

158
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:31,254
I'll shove those arrows
up your ass.

159
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,824
You can't let him go.
He's a murderer. He's guilty.

160
00:13:33,858 --> 00:13:35,992
- Not in the eyes of god.
- You can't!

161
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:39,196
Enough! The judgment
isn't ours to make.

162
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:45,035
Go in peace,
Sandor Clegane.

163
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,803
The Lord of Light
isn't done with you yet.

164
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:54,777
<i>Riders coming through!</i>

165
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:06,890
The Kingslayer.

166
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:07,992
Down!

167
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:10,194
On your knees.

168
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:13,331
Lord Bolton, I give you
the Kingslayer.

169
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:16,935
Pick him up, Locke.

170
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:25,010
You've lost a hand.

171
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:27,879
No, my lord,
he has it here.

172
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,317
- Take this away.
- Send it to his father?

173
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:35,453
You'll hold your tongue
unless you want to lose it.

174
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:39,157
Cut her free.
Apologies, my lady.

175
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:41,225
You're under
my protection now.

176
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:43,895
Thank you, my lord.

177
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:49,200
Find suitable rooms
for our guests.

178
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:51,970
We'll speak later.

179
00:14:53,606 --> 00:14:55,107
Lord Bolton.

180
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:00,979
Is there word
from the capital?

181
00:15:02,215 --> 00:15:03,782
You haven't heard?

182
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:07,953
Stannis Baratheon laid siege
to King's Landing.

183
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:10,422
<i>Sailed into Blackwater Bay.</i>

184
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:13,693
<i>Stormed the gates</i>
<i>with thousands of men.</i>

185
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:16,729
And your sister...

186
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:24,203
How can I put this?

187
00:15:26,406 --> 00:15:28,140
Your sister...

188
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,677
is alive and well.

189
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:34,513
Your father's forces
prevailed.

190
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:38,116
Ser Jaime isn't well.

191
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,585
Take him to Qyburn.

192
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:02,406
- Will I die?
- No.

193
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,841
The corruption
has spread.

194
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,876
I fear it must
be cut away.

195
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,979
The safest course would be
to take the whole arm off.

196
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:11,448
Then you'll die.

197
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:15,453
You're no maester.

198
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:18,222
Where's your chain?

199
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,324
The Citadel
stripped me of it.

200
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:23,594
They found some
of my experiments

201
00:16:23,662 --> 00:16:25,596
too bold.

202
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:29,268
I can leave your upper arm,
make the cut at your elbow.

203
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:33,072
I don't need my right hand
to kill you.

204
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,542
I can take away
the rotting flesh

205
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:39,245
and try and burn out
the corruption

206
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,514
- with boiling wine.
- Mmm.

207
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:43,749
With any luck,
that will suffice.

208
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:46,285
You'll need
milk of the poppy.

209
00:16:47,588 --> 00:16:49,588
- No milk of the poppy.
- There will be pain.

210
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:52,792
- I'll scream.
- Quite a bit of pain.

211
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:54,928
I'll scream loudly.

212
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:31,298
Lord Baelish.

213
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:32,966
Your Grace.

214
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:34,968
I wonder if I might
ask you for a favor.

215
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:36,403
Of course, Your Grace.

216
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:37,837
I have reason to believe
that House Tyrell

217
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:39,906
do not hold the crown's
best interests at heart.

218
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,410
I see. And have you shared these
suspicions with Lord Tywin?

219
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:47,379
My father's a practical man.
He appreciates facts.

220
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:50,082
Myself, I often
find them a hindrance.

221
00:17:50,117 --> 00:17:53,219
And he appreciates those
who aid his family, as you well know.

222
00:17:53,254 --> 00:17:54,788
He's almost as generous
to those who help us

223
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:58,024
as he is unpleasant
towards those who don't.

224
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:00,525
You have a good working
relationship with the Tyrells.

225
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,461
I thought you might look into it
before you leave the capital.

226
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:05,663
- I shall do my best.
- Thank you.

227
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:09,167
And your best will prove better than
when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?

228
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:10,969
I assure you
that it will.

229
00:18:18,243 --> 00:18:20,577
Gods, boy, that's enough.
We're not in a tavern.

230
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:22,012
- Pardon, my lady.
- No need to speak.

231
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:24,248
Are there any figs?
Fetch some.

232
00:18:24,282 --> 00:18:26,384
I always take figs
midafternoon.

233
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:27,885
They help move the bowels.

234
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,987
To what do I owe
this summons?

235
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:32,056
Thank you for seeing me,
my lady.

236
00:18:32,091 --> 00:18:34,325
I had hoped we might discuss
a few financial matters.

237
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:38,129
I climbed all those steps to discuss
financial matters?

238
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:39,430
It's the royal wedding.

239
00:18:39,464 --> 00:18:40,865
I'm told you had a hand
in planning it.

240
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:42,066
Naturally.

241
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,568
It's shaping up to be
a very involved affair.

242
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:46,703
The word extravagant
has been used.

243
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:48,405
What good
is the word extravagant

244
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,841
if it can't be used
to describe a royal wedding?

245
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,943
- I understand that.
- Good.

246
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:55,445
But, as Master of Coin,
it falls upon me

247
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:57,113
to calculate the cost
for the crown.

248
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:59,650
As of now,
it's a huge expense.

249
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:00,817
And?

250
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:04,521
And we're at war,
Lady Olenna.

251
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:06,924
Oh, I'd nearly
forgotten.

252
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,325
Yes, and maintaining
supply lines--

253
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,093
<i>I can't think</i>
<i>how it slipped my mind.</i>

254
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:12,729
What is it,
12,000 infantrymen

255
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:14,564
<i>the Tyrell family</i>
<i>has supplied?</i>

256
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:16,866
1,800 mounted lances.

257
00:19:16,901 --> 00:19:18,868
<i>2,000 in support.</i>

258
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:22,005
Provisions so this city
might survive the winter.

259
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,740
<i>A million bushels</i>
<i>of wheat.</i>

260
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:27,310
Half a million bushels each
of barley, oats, and rye.

261
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:29,112
<i>20,000 head of cattle.</i>

262
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:30,714
<i>50,000 sheep.</i>

263
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:33,217
You don't have to lecture me
about wartime expenses.

264
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:35,253
I'm quite familiar
with them.

265
00:19:35,287 --> 00:19:36,955
And we are so grateful
for your contributions

266
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:39,524
which are necessary
for the preservation of the realm.

267
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:41,427
As is a royal wedding.

268
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:44,030
The people are hungry
for more than just food.

269
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:45,498
They crave distractions.

270
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:48,801
And if we don't provide them,
they'll create their own.

271
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:51,471
And their distractions
are likely to end

272
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:53,773
with us being torn
to pieces.

273
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:56,142
<i>A royal wedding</i>
<i>is much safer.</i>

274
00:19:56,177 --> 00:19:59,212
- Wouldn't you say?
- I would.

275
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:01,414
<i>And traditionally</i>
<i>paid for</i>

276
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:03,517
by the royal family.

277
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:07,187
I was told you were
drunk, impertinent,

278
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:09,222
and thoroughly debauched.

279
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:10,824
You can imagine
my disappointment

280
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:13,827
at finding nothing
but a browbeaten bookkeeper.

281
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,298
Where did you go
for them, Volantis?

282
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,234
- My lady--
- Oh, very well.

283
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:23,270
I won't have it said
that House Tyrell

284
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:25,005
refuses to play
its part.

285
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,573
We'll pay for half
the expenses

286
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:29,242
and the celebrations
will go on as planned.

287
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:31,077
- Is that sufficient?
- Quite sufficient. Thank you.

288
00:20:31,112 --> 00:20:33,447
Very good, then.
That's settled. Good day.

289
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:38,585
Give me that.

290
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:45,225
<i>What are you doing?</i>

291
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,362
Just mending
Lord Beric's armor.

292
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:50,598
Why?

293
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:53,033
I'm going to stay on
and smith for the Brotherhood.

294
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:54,935
Have you lost your mind?

295
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:58,472
When the Lannisters find this place,
you think they'll spare the smiths?

296
00:20:58,506 --> 00:21:00,107
They'll cave your head in
with your own helmet.

297
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:02,909
The Lannisters wanted to kill me long
before I joined the Brotherhood.

298
00:21:02,943 --> 00:21:04,878
You don't have to do this.

299
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:06,713
I want to.

300
00:21:06,747 --> 00:21:08,181
They need good men.

301
00:21:08,216 --> 00:21:11,518
Robb needs good men, too.
We're leaving tomorrow.

302
00:21:11,552 --> 00:21:13,920
- And then you--
- What? Serve him?

303
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:17,991
I've served men
my entire life.

304
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,826
I served Master Mott
at King's Landing

305
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,462
and he sold me
to the Watch.

306
00:21:22,496 --> 00:21:24,097
I served Lord Tywin
at Harrenhal,

307
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:27,066
wondering every day
if I'd get tortured or killed.

308
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:29,502
I'm done serving.

309
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:31,871
You just said you were
serving Lord Beric.

310
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:36,675
He may be their leader,
but they chose him.

311
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,845
These men are brothers.
They're a family.

312
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:43,449
I've never had a family.

313
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:48,121
I can be your family.

314
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:53,994
You wouldn't be
my family.

315
00:21:54,028 --> 00:21:55,629
You'd be "my lady."

316
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:16,317
Willem.

317
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:20,488
Willem!

318
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:26,862
- Is this a rescue?
- Lannister filth! Take him!

319
00:22:26,896 --> 00:22:29,264
Please, I didn't do anything.
I'm just a squire.

320
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,099
Please--

321
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,314
Bring them in.

322
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:03,297
Is that all of them?

323
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:08,637
It took five of you to murder
two unarmed squires?

324
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:10,572
Not murder,
Your Grace.

325
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,140
Vengeance.

326
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:14,676
Vengeance?

327
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,078
Those boys didn't
kill your sons.

328
00:23:17,112 --> 00:23:20,181
I saw Harrion die
on the battlefield and Torrhen--

329
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:22,216
Was strangled
by the Kingslayer.

330
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,518
- They were his kin.
- They were boys!

331
00:23:26,687 --> 00:23:28,455
Look at them.

332
00:23:30,257 --> 00:23:31,891
Tell your mother
to look at them.

333
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:34,227
<i>She killed them</i>
<i>as much as I.</i>

334
00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:36,896
My mother had nothing
to do with this.

335
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,764
This was your treason.

336
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,233
It's treason
to free your enemies.

337
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:43,368
In war, you kill
your enemies.

338
00:23:43,402 --> 00:23:45,504
Did your father
not teach you that, boy?

339
00:23:45,538 --> 00:23:47,572
Leave him.

340
00:23:51,744 --> 00:23:53,345
Aye.

341
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:55,713
Leave me to the king.

342
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:59,384
He wants to give me
a scolding before he sets me free.

343
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:03,888
That's how he deals
with treason.

344
00:24:03,923 --> 00:24:06,224
Our King in the North.

345
00:24:06,258 --> 00:24:08,626
Or should I call him

346
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:11,696
the King Who Lost
the North?

347
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,034
Escort Lord Karstark
to the dungeon.

348
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:18,769
Hang the rest.

349
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,271
Mercy, sire!
I didn't kill anyone.

350
00:24:20,306 --> 00:24:21,773
I only watched
for the guards.

351
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:23,942
This one was only
the watcher.

352
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:26,044
Hang him last so he can watch
the others die.

353
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:28,180
<i>Please! Please, no.</i>
<i>They made me do it!</i>

354
00:24:28,214 --> 00:24:32,150
They made me!
They made me!

355
00:24:40,226 --> 00:24:42,661
Word of this
can't leave Riverrun.

356
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:44,563
They were Tywin
Lannister's nephews.

357
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:46,298
The Lannisters
pay their debts.

358
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:47,733
<i>They never stop</i>
<i>talking about it.</i>

359
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,702
Would you make me a liar
as well as a murderer?

360
00:24:49,736 --> 00:24:51,470
It wouldn't be lying.

361
00:24:51,504 --> 00:24:53,705
We will bury them
and remain silent

362
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,140
<i>until the war is done.</i>

363
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:56,575
I'm not fighting
for justice

364
00:24:56,609 --> 00:24:59,478
if I don't serve justice
to murderers in my ranks,

365
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:02,448
<i>no matter how highborn.</i>

366
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:05,051
He has to die.

367
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:07,787
The Karstarks
are Northmen.

368
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:10,156
They won't forgive
the killing of their lord.

369
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,158
Your mother's right.

370
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,961
If you do this, the Karstarks will
abandon you.

371
00:25:14,995 --> 00:25:17,063
You tended to their wounds.

372
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,800
You brought them supper.
Now they're dead.

373
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:23,671
And more boys will keep dying
until this war is over.

374
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:25,840
<i>You need Karstark men</i>
<i>to end it.</i>

375
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:28,309
Spare his life.
Keep him as a hostage.

376
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:30,411
A hostage.

377
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,749
<i>Tell the Karstarks</i>
<i>that as long as they remain loyal,</i>

378
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,851
he will not be harmed.

379
00:26:00,877 --> 00:26:04,146
The blood of the First Men
flows through my veins

380
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,182
as much as yours, boy.

381
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:09,918
I fought the Mad King
for your father.

382
00:26:09,952 --> 00:26:13,556
I fought Joffrey
for you.

383
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:15,058
We are kin--

384
00:26:15,092 --> 00:26:17,393
Stark and Karstark.

385
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:19,828
That didn't stop you
from betraying me.

386
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:21,430
And it won't save you now.

387
00:26:21,464 --> 00:26:24,332
I don't want it
to save me.

388
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:28,003
I want it to haunt you
to the end of your days.

389
00:26:28,938 --> 00:26:30,672
Kneel, my lord.

390
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:42,150
Rickard Karstark,

391
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,752
<i>Lord of Karhold,</i>

392
00:26:43,787 --> 00:26:47,290
here in sight of gods and men,
I sentence you to die.

393
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:50,226
Would you speak
a final word?

394
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:53,897
Kill me
and be cursed.

395
00:26:53,932 --> 00:26:57,034
You are no king of mine.

396
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:13,650
<i>Joffrey.</i>

397
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:15,685
Cersei.

398
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:19,356
Ilyn Payne.

399
00:27:20,926 --> 00:27:22,927
Ser Meryn.

400
00:27:26,065 --> 00:27:28,133
The Hound.

401
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:33,572
What are you
going to do with me?

402
00:27:33,607 --> 00:27:36,242
At first light
we'll ride for Riverrun.

403
00:27:36,276 --> 00:27:38,110
Your brother's there now.

404
00:27:38,145 --> 00:27:40,613
He'll make a contribution
to our cause

405
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:42,315
and you can go home.

406
00:27:42,349 --> 00:27:45,084
I'm a hostage
and you're selling me.

407
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,553
Don't think of it
that way.

408
00:27:46,587 --> 00:27:49,255
- But it is that way.
- <i>It is.</i>

409
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,124
- And it isn't.
- More is than isn't.

410
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:57,263
Beric admired your father
a great deal, you know.

411
00:27:57,297 --> 00:27:59,432
He wanted to refuse
your ransom altogether.

412
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:02,968
- So why don't you?
- We need the gold.

413
00:28:15,082 --> 00:28:16,749
Do I frighten you, child?

414
00:28:16,784 --> 00:28:18,618
No.

415
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:23,189
You're angry with me.

416
00:28:23,223 --> 00:28:24,857
And I don't blame you.

417
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:26,411
But letting him go
was the right thing.

418
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:28,995
I have more reason than most
to want him hanged.

419
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:31,530
- I thought he killed you.
- He did.

420
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:33,399
But how...?

421
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:35,601
Thoros...

422
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:37,503
how many times
have you brought me back?

423
00:28:37,537 --> 00:28:41,006
It's the Lord of Light
brings you back.

424
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,274
I'm just the lucky drunk
who says the words.

425
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:45,943
- How many times?
- <i>Five, I think.</i>

426
00:28:45,978 --> 00:28:48,112
<i>No, this makes six.</i>

427
00:28:48,146 --> 00:28:49,480
Six.

428
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:52,483
There was the first time--
the Mountain.

429
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:54,051
<i>Show her.</i>

430
00:28:54,085 --> 00:28:57,854
Lance right through
the chest.

431
00:28:57,889 --> 00:29:00,324
Then I was stabbed
in the belly.

432
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:01,725
Then it was an arrow
in the back.

433
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,494
<i>And that axe in the side.</i>

434
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:07,864
Then the Lannisters caught me
and executed me for treason.

435
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,735
Was it a hanging
or a dagger in the eye?

436
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:14,938
Both.
Fuckers couldn't decide.

437
00:29:14,972 --> 00:29:17,507
<i>And the Hound makes six.</i>

438
00:29:17,542 --> 00:29:19,677
Second time I've been
killed by a Clegane.

439
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:21,712
<i>You'd think you'd learn.</i>

440
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:25,950
It's not getting
any easier, you know.

441
00:29:25,984 --> 00:29:27,985
<i>I know.</i>

442
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:30,120
<i>Every time I come back,</i>

443
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:32,189
I'm a bit less.

444
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,193
Pieces of you
get chipped away.

445
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:39,997
Could you bring back
a man without a head?

446
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:45,635
Not six times.
Just once.

447
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,572
I don't think it works
that way, child.

448
00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:57,148
He was a good man,
Ned Stark.

449
00:29:57,182 --> 00:30:01,085
<i>He's at rest now,</i>
<i>somewhere.</i>

450
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,520
I would never wish
my life upon him.

451
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:05,689
I would.

452
00:30:07,993 --> 00:30:10,094
You're alive.

453
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:18,101
Lord, cast your light
upon me.

454
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,506
Protect me
in the darkness.

455
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,043
Burn away my sins.

456
00:30:26,077 --> 00:30:29,313
Help me serve you.

457
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:31,516
Use me as you will.

458
00:30:33,986 --> 00:30:36,588
For the night is dark

459
00:30:36,623 --> 00:30:39,124
and full of terrors.

460
00:30:50,203 --> 00:30:53,105
I have prayed day and night
for you to come to me.

461
00:30:54,741 --> 00:30:56,809
My lady.

462
00:30:56,843 --> 00:30:59,678
I meant to come sooner.

463
00:30:59,712 --> 00:31:02,948
- The battle--
- I know of your troubles, my king.

464
00:31:02,982 --> 00:31:05,718
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

465
00:31:05,752 --> 00:31:08,254
Yes, of course.

466
00:31:17,499 --> 00:31:20,768
You mustn't despair.
Your claim is true.

467
00:31:20,802 --> 00:31:23,570
- You will be victorious.
- I believed that once.

468
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:27,041
You are
the one god's champion

469
00:31:27,075 --> 00:31:29,310
and the finest man
I've ever known.

470
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:31,812
Selyse.

471
00:31:33,114 --> 00:31:35,649
I've broken a sacred vow.

472
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,488
I've sinned.

473
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:43,658
- No.
- I've wronged you.

474
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:47,295
- I have shamed you.
- You're doing god's work.

475
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,398
You don't understand.

476
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,106
The Red Woman--

477
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:00,576
the Lady Melisandre--

478
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:02,578
I know, Stannis.

479
00:32:02,613 --> 00:32:06,649
The Lady Melisandre
has told me everything.

480
00:32:06,683 --> 00:32:09,919
No act done in service
of the Lord of Light

481
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:12,722
can ever be a sin.

482
00:32:12,756 --> 00:32:16,026
When she told me,

483
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,263
I wept with joy.

484
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:34,411
Oh, my sweet boys.

485
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:39,583
<i>Petyr, Tommard,</i>

486
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:41,619
<i>Edric.</i>

487
00:32:42,721 --> 00:32:46,457
I thank god
every day

488
00:32:46,492 --> 00:32:49,528
<i>for bringing</i>
<i>Melisandre to us.</i>

489
00:32:49,562 --> 00:32:51,897
She gave you a son.

490
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,868
I gave you...

491
00:32:57,037 --> 00:32:59,471
- <i>nothing.</i>
- That's not true.

492
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,911
So you've come
to see her as well?

493
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:11,281
There is no need.

494
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:15,251
You must keep away
from such distractions.

495
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,986
She's my daughter.

496
00:33:19,256 --> 00:33:20,623
I want to see her.

497
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:25,963
You are a king.

498
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:28,799
You don't need
my permission.

Father!

508
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:06,571
You've grown
since I last saw you.

509
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:10,109
Mother said you fought
in a battle.

510
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:11,711
Did you win?

511
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:15,014
No.

512
00:34:15,048 --> 00:34:17,483
Did the Onion Knight
come back with you?

513
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:20,953
He did.

514
00:34:20,987 --> 00:34:22,722
He fought bravely.

515
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:24,423
He hasn't come
to visit me.

516
00:34:24,457 --> 00:34:27,459
He said he'd bring me back a
present from the capital.

517
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:29,161
He won't be visiting, child.

518
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:31,729
Why not?
He's my friend.

519
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:33,331
Look.

520
00:34:40,471 --> 00:34:42,539
He made this for me.

521
00:34:42,574 --> 00:34:44,942
But don't tell Mother
I have it.

522
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:46,877
It's a secret.

523
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,580
Mother doesn't like
the Onion Knight.

524
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,052
Ser Davos
is a traitor.

525
00:34:56,021 --> 00:34:59,324
He's rotting in a dungeon
cell for his crime.

526
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:10,535
Best forget him.

527
00:35:22,315 --> 00:35:25,217
Not so hard.
You'll scrub the skin off.

528
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:26,685
What are you
doing here?

529
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,053
I need a bath.

530
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:30,723
Help me out
of these rags.

531
00:35:37,731 --> 00:35:40,199
Now get out.

532
00:35:52,613 --> 00:35:54,247
There's another tub.

533
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:57,216
This one suits me fine.

534
00:36:09,929 --> 00:36:12,730
Don't worry.
I'm not interested.

535
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:18,135
<i>If I faint, pull me out.</i>

536
00:36:18,169 --> 00:36:21,204
I don't intend to be the first Lannister
to die in a bathtub.

537
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:23,006
Why should I care
how you die?

538
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,009
You swore a solemn vow,
remember?

539
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:29,712
You're supposed to get me to
King's Landing in one piece.

540
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:33,182
Not going so well, is it?

541
00:36:33,217 --> 00:36:35,851
No wonder Renly died
with you guarding him.

542
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,997
That was unworthy.
Forgive me.

543
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,999
You protected me
better than most--

544
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:52,769
- Don't you mock me.
- I'm apologizing.

545
00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:56,640
I'm sick of fighting.

546
00:36:56,674 --> 00:36:58,142
<i>Let's call a truce.</i>

547
00:36:58,176 --> 00:36:59,977
You need trust
to have a truce.

548
00:37:01,379 --> 00:37:03,648
I trust you.

549
00:37:10,457 --> 00:37:13,526
<i>There it is.</i>
<i>There's the look.</i>

550
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,029
I've seen it for 17 years

551
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:17,697
on face after face.

552
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:20,967
<i>You all despise me.</i>

553
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:22,735
Kingslayer.

554
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,938
Oathbreaker.

555
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:27,874
A man without honor.

556
00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:35,047
You've heard of wildfire?

557
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:36,582
Of course.

558
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:39,385
<i>The Mad King</i>
<i>was obsessed with it.</i>

559
00:37:39,419 --> 00:37:41,954
He loved to watch
people burn,

560
00:37:41,988 --> 00:37:44,523
the way their skin
blackened and blistered

561
00:37:44,557 --> 00:37:47,159
<i>and melted</i>
<i>off their bones.</i>

562
00:37:47,194 --> 00:37:49,362
<i>He burned lords</i>
<i>he didn't like.</i>

563
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:51,464
<i>He burned Hands</i>
<i>who disobeyed him.</i>

564
00:37:51,498 --> 00:37:54,933
He burned anyone
who was against him.

565
00:37:56,336 --> 00:37:59,637
Before long, half the country
was against him.

566
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:05,042
Aerys saw traitors
everywhere.

567
00:38:06,512 --> 00:38:10,581
So he had his pyromancer
place caches of wildfire

568
00:38:10,615 --> 00:38:13,050
<i>all over the city--</i>

569
00:38:13,084 --> 00:38:15,352
beneath the Sept
of Baelor

570
00:38:15,387 --> 00:38:17,154
and the slums
of Flea Bottom.

571
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:20,492
Under houses,
stables, taverns.

572
00:38:20,526 --> 00:38:23,862
Even beneath
the Red Keep itself.

573
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:28,000
Finally,

574
00:38:28,034 --> 00:38:31,270
the day
of reckoning came.

575
00:38:31,305 --> 00:38:33,673
Robert Baratheon
marched on the capital

576
00:38:33,707 --> 00:38:35,775
after his victory
at the Trident.

577
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,211
But my father
arrived first

578
00:38:38,245 --> 00:38:40,980
with the whole Lannister
army at his back,

579
00:38:41,015 --> 00:38:45,418
promising to defend the city
against the rebels.

580
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,321
I knew my father
better than that.

581
00:38:49,356 --> 00:38:52,691
<i>He's never been one</i>
<i>to pick the losing side.</i>

582
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:55,294
<i>I told the Mad King</i>
<i>as much.</i>

583
00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:59,064
I urged him
to surrender peacefully.

584
00:38:59,098 --> 00:39:02,300
<i>But the king didn't</i>
<i>listen to me.</i>

585
00:39:02,335 --> 00:39:05,037
He didn't listen to Varys
who tried to warn him.

586
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:09,441
But he did listen
to Grand Maester Pycelle,

587
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:12,144
that grey, sunken cunt.

588
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,449
"You can trust
the Lannisters," he said.

589
00:39:18,085 --> 00:39:20,353
"The Lannisters
have always been

590
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,622
true friends
of the crown."

591
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:27,493
So we opened the gates

592
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:29,762
and my father
sacked the city.

593
00:39:29,796 --> 00:39:33,199
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>I came to the king,</i>

594
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:36,402
begging him to surrender.

595
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:42,508
He told me to...

596
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:45,077
bring him
my father's head.

597
00:39:46,413 --> 00:39:48,480
Then he...

598
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:51,483
turned to his pyromancer.

599
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:54,285
"Burn them all,"
he said.

600
00:39:55,354 --> 00:39:58,390
"Burn them
in their homes.

601
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:00,559
Burn them
in their beds."

602
00:40:01,928 --> 00:40:06,700
Tell me,
if your precious Renly

603
00:40:06,734 --> 00:40:09,603
commanded you to kill
your own father

604
00:40:09,637 --> 00:40:12,673
and stand by while
thousands of men,

605
00:40:12,707 --> 00:40:14,942
women, and children
burned alive,

606
00:40:14,976 --> 00:40:17,678
would you have done it?

607
00:40:17,712 --> 00:40:19,513
Would you have
kept your oath then?

608
00:40:23,484 --> 00:40:27,087
First, I killed
the pyromancer.

609
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:30,724
<i>And then when the king</i>
<i>turned to flee,</i>

610
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:34,261
I drove my sword
into his back.

611
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:37,998
<i>"Burn them all,"</i>
<i>he kept saying.</i>

612
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:40,000
"Burn them all."

613
00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:42,269
I don't think
he expected to die.

614
00:40:42,304 --> 00:40:45,239
He-- he meant to...

615
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:49,276
burn with the rest of us

616
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,112
and rise again,

617
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:54,014
reborn as a dragon

618
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:55,949
to turn his enemies
to ash.

619
00:40:59,721 --> 00:41:03,290
I slit his throat to make sure
that didn't happen.

620
00:41:07,395 --> 00:41:11,164
That's where Ned Stark
found me.

621
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:13,399
If this is true...

622
00:41:15,035 --> 00:41:16,903
why didn't you tell anyone?

623
00:41:18,906 --> 00:41:20,773
Why didn't you tell
Lord Stark?

624
00:41:20,808 --> 00:41:22,308
Stark?

625
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:24,811
You think

626
00:41:24,845 --> 00:41:28,782
the honorable Ned Stark

627
00:41:28,816 --> 00:41:32,086
wanted to hear my side?

628
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,821
He judged me guilty

629
00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:37,257
the moment
he set eyes on me.

630
00:41:40,362 --> 00:41:44,198
By what right
does the wolf

631
00:41:44,232 --> 00:41:46,233
judge the lion?

632
00:41:47,536 --> 00:41:49,103
- By what right?
- Help! Help!

633
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:50,771
The Kingslayer!

634
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,108
Jaime.

635
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:56,144
My name is Jaime.

636
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:01,717
<i>Onion Knight.</i>

637
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:03,686
<i>Ser Onion Knight.</i>

638
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,356
Princess?
Gods, what are you doing here?

639
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:09,858
- Shh, you'll wake Bert.
- Bert?

640
00:42:09,893 --> 00:42:12,962
He's the fat one.
He's on guard duty tonight.

641
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:14,897
He likes to drink wine
and sleep a lot.

642
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,499
Go back to your room.
You're not supposed to be here.

643
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,668
- If your father knew--
- He said you were a traitor.

644
00:42:19,702 --> 00:42:21,937
Are you?

645
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:24,539
I am, child.

646
00:42:24,573 --> 00:42:26,508
I disobeyed my king,
your father,

647
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:28,376
and now I'm paying
the price.

648
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:30,912
I don't care.
You're my friend.

649
00:42:30,947 --> 00:42:32,881
You must get bored
down here.

650
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,850
I brought you
something to read.

651
00:42:34,884 --> 00:42:36,719
It's about Aegon
and his dragons.

652
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:40,188
Aegon used to live here.
Did you know that?

653
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:42,024
- And the Targaryens built this castle.
- Aye.

654
00:42:42,025 --> 00:42:44,326
- So they did.
- You can hide the book under your cloak.

655
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,729
It's a good one.
I'll bring you more.

656
00:42:46,763 --> 00:42:49,632
Thank you, my lady.
I'm sure it's a fine book,

657
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:51,067
but it's wasted on me.

658
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,569
Take it.
I have more.

659
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,306
My lady, I can't read
the words.

660
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,409
You can't?

661
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:02,145
I'll teach you. I'll come when
Bert's on duty and teach you.

662
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,013
- No. No. No.
- It's easy. It'll be fun.

663
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,182
- Go. We can't.
- Why not?

664
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:08,985
What will they do,
lock us in cells?

665
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:16,960
I wouldn't know
where to start.

666
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:18,728
At the beginning.

667
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,663
This word is Aegon.

668
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:24,801
When you see A, E, and G
together like that,

669
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,736
it sounds like egg.

670
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,672
And the title
of the whole book

671
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,874
is "An History
of Aegon the Conqueror

672
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,076
<i>and His Conquest</i>
<i>of Westeros."</i>

673
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,923
It was a bitch
of a siege.

674
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,126
Mm, you were first
through the breach at Pyke?

675
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,629
The second.
Thoros of Myr went in alone,

676
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,831
waving that
flaming sword of his.

677
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:57,567
Thoros of Myr.
Bloody madman.

678
00:43:57,601 --> 00:44:00,537
Robert knighted you
after the battle?

679
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,439
Proudest moment
of my life.

680
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,675
One knee in the dust,
the king's sword on my shoulder,

681
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,010
listening to the words.

682
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:10,747
"In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave."

683
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:13,718
All I could think of
was how badly I had to piss.

684
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,655
In full plate metal
for 16 hours.

685
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,658
Never occurred to me
till the fighting was over.

686
00:44:19,692 --> 00:44:22,895
I was very nearly the first man
knighted to piss on the king's boots.

687
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:26,966
Robert would have
laughed.

688
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,602
He was a good man,
a great warrior.

689
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:33,372
And a terrible king.

690
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,775
I burned away my years
fighting for terrible kings.

691
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,344
- You swore an oath.
- Yes.

692
00:44:38,378 --> 00:44:40,246
And a man of honor
keeps his vows,

693
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,682
even if he's serving
a drunk or a lunatic.

694
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:46,285
Just once in my life
before it's over,

695
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,355
I want to know what it's like
to serve with pride,

696
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:52,525
to fight for someone
I believe in.

697
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,326
Do you believe in her?

698
00:44:57,163 --> 00:44:58,998
With all my heart.

699
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:05,604
These are the ones?

700
00:45:05,639 --> 00:45:07,773
Yes, khaleesi.
The officers.

701
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:45,845
All Unsullied boys
are given new names

702
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:47,479
when they are cut--

703
00:45:47,514 --> 00:45:50,382
Grey Worm, Red Flea,
Black Rat.

704
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:53,185
<i>Names that remind them</i>
<i>what they are--</i>

705
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,721
vermin.

706
00:46:42,637 --> 00:46:45,005
<i>King Robert</i>
<i>wanted her dead.</i>

707
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,273
Of course
he wanted her dead.

708
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:49,410
She's a Targaryen.
The last Targaryen.

709
00:46:49,445 --> 00:46:52,547
I suppose no one on the small
council could speak sense to him.

710
00:46:52,581 --> 00:46:55,116
- I didn't sit on the small council.
- No?

711
00:46:55,151 --> 00:46:57,752
Doesn't the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard traditionally--

712
00:46:57,787 --> 00:46:59,654
Traditionally, yes,
but I killed a dozen

713
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:01,823
of Robert's friends
during his rebellion.

714
00:47:03,992 --> 00:47:05,659
He didn't want advice
on how to govern

715
00:47:05,694 --> 00:47:07,628
from a man who had fought
for the Mad King.

716
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:10,564
Can't say
I minded much.

717
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:12,766
I always hated
the politics.

718
00:47:12,801 --> 00:47:14,735
Yeah, I imagine
I would, too.

719
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:17,204
Hours spent jabbering
about backstabbings

720
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:20,407
- and betrayals the world over.
- Mm-hmm.

721
00:47:23,578 --> 00:47:25,479
Still, she'll have
to wade through that muck

722
00:47:25,513 --> 00:47:27,715
if she wants to rule
the Seven Kingdoms.

723
00:47:27,749 --> 00:47:29,817
She'll have good men
around her to advise her,

724
00:47:29,851 --> 00:47:31,318
men with experience.

725
00:47:31,353 --> 00:47:32,853
Which men do you
have in mind?

726
00:47:32,888 --> 00:47:34,889
Forgive me, Ser Jorah,
for what I'm about to say,

727
00:47:34,923 --> 00:47:38,493
but your reputation in Westeros
has suffered over the years.

728
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:40,929
It suffered for a reason.

729
00:47:40,963 --> 00:47:42,730
I sold men into slavery.

730
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:44,599
I don't know
if your presence by her side

731
00:47:44,633 --> 00:47:46,901
will help our cause
when we go home.

732
00:47:46,935 --> 00:47:48,736
Our cause?

733
00:47:48,771 --> 00:47:50,805
Forgive me, Ser Barristan,
but I was busy

734
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,041
defending the khaleesi against
King Robert's assassins

735
00:47:53,075 --> 00:47:54,876
while you were still
bowing to the man.

736
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,912
We both want her to rule.
Am I wrong?

737
00:47:57,947 --> 00:48:00,548
You only joined us
a few days ago.

738
00:48:00,582 --> 00:48:02,716
I can't speak
to your intentions.

739
00:48:02,751 --> 00:48:04,885
If we're truly
her loyal servants,

740
00:48:04,919 --> 00:48:07,721
we will do whatever
needs to be done,

741
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:10,357
no matter the cost,
no matter our pride.

742
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:12,959
You're not
Lord Commander here.

743
00:48:12,994 --> 00:48:15,562
You're just another exile.

744
00:48:15,596 --> 00:48:17,664
And I take my orders
from the queen.

745
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,674
<i>- Come to bed.</i>
- You were right.

746
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,644
The Karstarks are gone.

747
00:48:32,612 --> 00:48:34,847
Almost half our forces.

748
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:38,384
Tywin Lannister knows what he
needs to do to make us unravel.

749
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:41,287
Nothing.

750
00:48:41,322 --> 00:48:43,456
Only wait.

751
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,992
Don't let him.

752
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:48,127
What can I do?

753
00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:49,595
Attack King's Landing?

754
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,764
There's nothing
he'd like better.

755
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:53,799
He'd crush us
in a day.

756
00:48:54,835 --> 00:48:55,968
We could ride north.

757
00:48:56,002 --> 00:48:58,671
<i>Take your land back</i>
<i>from the Greyjoys.</i>

758
00:48:58,705 --> 00:49:01,974
- Wait out the winter.
- Winter could last five years.

759
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:03,375
Once my bannermen
are home again,

760
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,179
sitting by the fire,
surrounded by their families,

761
00:49:06,213 --> 00:49:09,282
warm and safe,
they'll never ride south again.

762
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:11,451
When I gathered
my lords together,

763
00:49:11,486 --> 00:49:13,387
we had a purpose,
a mission.

764
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:16,189
Now we're like a band
of bickering children.

765
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,461
Give them a new purpose.

766
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:22,196
What?

767
00:49:23,698 --> 00:49:25,899
Oh, I don't know.

768
00:49:25,934 --> 00:49:28,435
I don't even know
where Winterfell is.

769
00:49:31,105 --> 00:49:33,040
Here.

770
00:49:36,278 --> 00:49:39,847
And we're here.
King's Landing--

771
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:48,256
What is it?

772
00:49:51,493 --> 00:49:54,662
I can't force them
to meet us in the field

773
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:57,097
and I can't attack them
where they're strongest,

774
00:49:57,131 --> 00:50:00,034
but I can attack them
where they're not.

775
00:50:01,203 --> 00:50:04,071
And Casterly Rock
can't run away.

776
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:08,376
I'm going to take
their home away from them.

777
00:50:09,645 --> 00:50:11,813
Can you do it?

778
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:14,850
I need men to replace the Karstarks
who marched home.

779
00:50:14,884 --> 00:50:17,486
There is only one person
in this kingdom

780
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,722
with that kind of army who hasn't
already sided with the Lannisters.

781
00:50:22,158 --> 00:50:24,859
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry--

782
00:50:25,895 --> 00:50:27,795
Walder Frey.

783
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,939
He's such
a splendid fighter.

784
00:50:38,973 --> 00:50:42,309
Do you have any idea
when we might...

785
00:50:42,344 --> 00:50:45,980
I'll plant the seed
as soon as Joffrey and I are married.

786
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:47,481
It should grow quickly.

787
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:49,149
Joffrey won't let me leave.

788
00:50:49,184 --> 00:50:51,919
He's got too many reasons
to keep me here.

789
00:50:51,953 --> 00:50:55,289
And only one
to let you go.

790
00:50:55,323 --> 00:50:57,524
Because it will
please me.

791
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,593
<i>Squire!</i>

792
00:51:03,165 --> 00:51:04,832
Well fought, ser.

793
00:51:04,866 --> 00:51:07,634
That was no fight.
I don't know you.

794
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:10,003
Olyver,
if it please you.

795
00:51:12,173 --> 00:51:15,041
I should like to see you spar with
a proper partner, ser.

796
00:51:23,084 --> 00:51:24,617
How did you know?

797
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:26,553
Know what?

798
00:51:27,888 --> 00:51:29,723
That I wanted to.

799
00:51:29,757 --> 00:51:31,624
My lord...

800
00:51:35,662 --> 00:51:37,330
I'll have you know
I'm to be married soon

801
00:51:37,364 --> 00:51:40,433
and even my intended
hasn't the slightest notion.

802
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:43,570
They rarely do,
in my experience.

803
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:45,972
You have a good deal
of experience, do you?

804
00:51:46,907 --> 00:51:49,075
With the husbands.

805
00:51:57,919 --> 00:52:00,254
That didn't take long.

806
00:52:00,289 --> 00:52:02,491
Well, it took long enough.

807
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,029
It seems our Knight of Flowers
is engaged to be wed.

808
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:08,864
Is he?

809
00:52:08,898 --> 00:52:11,199
And...

810
00:52:11,234 --> 00:52:13,035
who's the lucky girl?

811
00:52:13,069 --> 00:52:16,572
<i>She may not be the grandest</i>
<i>ship in the world</i>

812
00:52:16,606 --> 00:52:19,074
or the fastest,

813
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:21,277
but she's mine.

814
00:52:24,815 --> 00:52:26,749
I've always wanted a ship.

815
00:52:26,783 --> 00:52:28,918
Now I want a dozen.

816
00:52:28,953 --> 00:52:31,588
- Strange, isn't it?
- What is?

817
00:52:31,622 --> 00:52:33,791
It doesn't matter
what we want,

818
00:52:33,825 --> 00:52:35,626
once we get it,

819
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,395
then we want
something else.

820
00:52:40,165 --> 00:52:42,867
Your hair is different.

821
00:52:42,901 --> 00:52:44,535
Is it?

822
00:52:44,569 --> 00:52:46,170
Lady Margaery
wears it that way.

823
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,606
Many ladies
wear it this way.

824
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,375
I have good news.

825
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:52,510
I'll be leaving
the city soon.

826
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,011
You still want me
to come with you?

827
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,247
It's not a question
of what I want.

828
00:52:56,281 --> 00:52:58,483
It's what you want.

829
00:52:58,517 --> 00:52:59,717
You want to go home,
don't you?

830
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:02,186
Of course.
More than anything.

831
00:53:04,356 --> 00:53:07,758
But maybe it would
be better to wait.

832
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:10,595
I've been thinking
how dangerous it would be.

833
00:53:10,629 --> 00:53:13,497
Not just for me,
but for you.

834
00:53:13,532 --> 00:53:14,798
You've been so kind.

835
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:18,001
I'd feel terrible if anything
happened to you.

836
00:53:19,137 --> 00:53:21,371
I can't tell you
how touched I am

837
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:24,641
by your concern
for my welfare.

838
00:53:24,676 --> 00:53:27,478
I hope you know that
I'm your friend, Sansa.

839
00:53:27,545 --> 00:53:29,546
Your true friend.

840
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,281
I do, Lord Baelish.

841
00:53:31,316 --> 00:53:33,985
- Petyr.
- Petyr.

842
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:36,120
If you wish to stay,

843
00:53:36,154 --> 00:53:39,156
then of course
you will stay.

844
00:53:44,062 --> 00:53:46,430
We'll speak again
when I return.

845
00:53:59,443 --> 00:54:01,577
<i>You're late.</i>

846
00:54:01,611 --> 00:54:04,413
What's she doing here?

847
00:54:04,448 --> 00:54:06,482
Our business
concerns her, too.

848
00:54:06,516 --> 00:54:08,350
<i>Sit.</i>

849
00:54:10,354 --> 00:54:11,954
You'll be pleased to learn

850
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:15,057
that after one conversation
with Olenna Tyrell,

851
00:54:15,091 --> 00:54:17,125
I've saved the crown

852
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,962
hundreds of thousands
on this wedding.

853
00:54:19,996 --> 00:54:21,030
Never mind that now.

854
00:54:21,064 --> 00:54:22,584
We have something
important to discuss.

855
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:25,034
I'm Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.

856
00:54:25,936 --> 00:54:27,370
Stop that.

857
00:54:27,404 --> 00:54:29,338
You're making me
uncomfortable.

858
00:54:29,373 --> 00:54:32,342
Your sister has learned that
your new friends the Tyrells

859
00:54:32,377 --> 00:54:35,380
are plotting to marry
Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

860
00:54:35,414 --> 00:54:37,182
Very well.

861
00:54:37,216 --> 00:54:39,250
She's a lovely girl.

862
00:54:39,285 --> 00:54:41,285
Missing some of Loras'
favorite bits,

863
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,121
but I'm sure
they'll make do.

864
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:45,690
- Your jokes are not appreciated.
- It wasn't my best, but--

865
00:54:45,724 --> 00:54:48,826
I bring them into the royal fold
and this is how they repay me,

866
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:52,330
by trying to steal the key to
the North out from under me.

867
00:54:52,364 --> 00:54:54,032
Sansa is the key
to the North?

868
00:54:54,066 --> 00:54:56,434
I seem to remember
she has an older brother.

869
00:54:56,468 --> 00:54:58,469
The Karstarks
have marched home.

870
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:01,439
The young wolf has lost half his army.
His days are numbered.

871
00:55:01,474 --> 00:55:04,576
<i>Theon Greyjoy murdered</i>
<i>both his brothers.</i>

872
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,946
That makes Sansa Stark
the heir to Winterfell.

873
00:55:07,981 --> 00:55:11,817
And I am not about
to hand her over to the Tyrells.

874
00:55:11,852 --> 00:55:14,153
<i>The Tyrell army is helping</i>
<i>us to win this war.</i>

875
00:55:14,188 --> 00:55:16,956
Do you really think
it's wise to refuse them?

876
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,791
There's nothing to refuse.
This is a plot.

877
00:55:18,826 --> 00:55:21,628
<i>Plots are not</i>
<i>public knowledge.</i>

878
00:55:21,662 --> 00:55:23,396
And the Tyrells
won't carry this one out

879
00:55:23,431 --> 00:55:25,598
until after
Joffrey's wedding.

880
00:55:25,633 --> 00:55:29,402
We need to act first
and kill this union in its crib.

881
00:55:29,436 --> 00:55:30,837
And how do we do that?

882
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:33,138
We find Sansa Stark
a different husband.

883
00:55:33,173 --> 00:55:35,774
- Wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

884
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:44,917
You can't mean it.

885
00:55:44,951 --> 00:55:46,418
I can and I do.

886
00:55:46,453 --> 00:55:49,555
Joffrey has made this
poor girl's life miserable

887
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:51,624
since the day he took
her father's head.

888
00:55:51,658 --> 00:55:54,693
Now she's finally free of
him and you give her to me?

889
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,428
That's cruel even for you.

890
00:55:56,463 --> 00:55:58,330
Do you intend
on mistreating her?

891
00:55:58,365 --> 00:56:00,299
The girl's happiness
is not my concern,

892
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:02,568
- nor should it be yours.
- She's a child!

893
00:56:02,603 --> 00:56:05,472
She's flowered, I assure you.
She and I have discussed it at length.

894
00:56:05,506 --> 00:56:09,009
There, you see? You will wed her,
bed her, and put a child in her.

895
00:56:09,043 --> 00:56:12,079
- <i>Surely you're capable of that.</i>
- And if I refuse?

896
00:56:12,114 --> 00:56:14,783
You wanted to be rewarded
for your valor in battle.

897
00:56:14,817 --> 00:56:18,820
Sansa Stark is a finer reward than
you could ever dare hope for.

898
00:56:18,854 --> 00:56:21,356
And it is past time
you were wed.

899
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,225
I was wed.

900
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,828
Or don't you remember?

901
00:56:28,264 --> 00:56:30,398
Only too well.

902
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:33,802
<i>You should be thanking</i>
<i>the gods for this.</i>

903
00:56:33,836 --> 00:56:35,470
This is more
than you deserve.

904
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:37,973
<i>Tyrion will do as he's bid.</i>

905
00:56:38,007 --> 00:56:40,075
As will you.

906
00:56:41,477 --> 00:56:43,578
What do you mean?

907
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:45,480
You'll marry Ser Loras.

908
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:50,085
- I will not.
- The boy is heir to Highgarden.

909
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:52,588
Tyrion will secure the North,
you will secure the Reach.

910
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:55,358
- No, I won't do it.
- Yes, you will.

911
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:58,094
You're still fertile.
You need to marry again and breed.

912
00:56:58,128 --> 00:57:00,296
I am Queen Regent,
not some broodmare.

913
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:02,999
You're my daughter!

914
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:04,668
You will do as I command

915
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:06,937
and you will marry
Loras Tyrell

916
00:57:06,971 --> 00:57:09,306
and put an end
to the disgusting rumors

917
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:12,142
about you
once and for all.

918
00:57:12,177 --> 00:57:14,278
Father, don't make me
do it again, please.

919
00:57:14,312 --> 00:57:16,848
Not another word.

920
00:57:16,882 --> 00:57:19,950
My children.

921
00:57:19,985 --> 00:57:23,888
You've disgraced the Lannister
name for far too long.
