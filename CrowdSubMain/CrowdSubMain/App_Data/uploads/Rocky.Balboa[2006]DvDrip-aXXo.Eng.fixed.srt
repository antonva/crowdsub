1
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,584
<i>Yet another quick knockout for
Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.</i>

2
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:53,749
<i>The fans let him know
how they feel about it.</i>

3
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,961
<i>Hide the women and children.
This could get ugly.</i>

4
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,318
<i>This crowd does nothing to hide
its anger over this latest debacle.</i>

5
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:04,504
<i>The fans are mad as hell.
They don't want to take it anymore.</i>

6
00:02:04,585 --> 00:02:07,611
<i>They seem to be blaming Dixon,
a good fighter, for the decline...</i>

7
00:02:07,656 --> 00:02:12,106
<i>... not only of the heavyweight-division
guys, but of the entire sport.</i>

8
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:13,589
<i>They're actually pelting...</i>

9
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:17,409
<i>... the undefeated heavyweight
champion of the world with ice.</i>

10
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:21,289
<i>Maybe this angry, visceral reaction
will pressure Dixon to fight someone...</i>

11
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:24,366
<i>... who can fight back for a change.
If there's somebody out there.</i>

12
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:29,866
<i>All of boxing is hoping for a warrior
who thrills us with his passion.</i>

13
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:59,932
Time goes by too fast.

14
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:03,423
Yeah? Not fast enough.

15
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:05,779
- Your kid should've been here.
- That's all right.

16
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:09,405
- No, it ain't all right.
- The kid gets a little busy sometimes.

17
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,193
He don't get that busy.

18
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:15,737
Let's not talk about it here, okay?
You're coming tonight, right?

19
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:19,625
I'm working. I took the tour
the last three years.

20
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,823
I know, but it's the anniversary.

21
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:23,606
Fine. You got my word.

22
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:28,363
I appreciate it, thank you.
I owe you, Paulie.

23
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:03,051
Yo, Robert. What's going on?
Where have you been? You're late.

24
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:07,501
No. I don't wanna hear this.
Look, your job performance...

25
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,657
...is nowhere near good enough
to be pulling this.

26
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:13,817
I don't give a damn who your father is.
You understand me?

27
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:16,229
- All right. Now get out of here.
- Okay.

28
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:18,108
Thank you, sir.

29
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,803
Yo, Robert. Yo.

30
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:24,716
- Hey, Rocky.
- Hey.

31
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:26,224
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

32
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:27,903
What's up, champ?

33
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:29,784
- You caught me off guard.
- I know.

34
00:06:29,885 --> 00:06:31,903
I wanted to catch you
before you got busy.

35
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:33,720
Yeah, it gets busy up there.

36
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:36,529
- So how you doing? Yeah?
- Real good. Yeah.

37
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:39,947
- Yo, Rock!
- Yeah, how you doing?

38
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:41,692
Yeah, real good.

39
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:44,504
Listen, you wanna go out
and get some coffee?

40
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:46,336
I'm kind of behind. Maybe later?

41
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:49,963
Yeah. That'd be great. You ought to
come by the restaurant tonight.

42
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:52,545
I can have something
made special for you.

43
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:56,681
Tonight I can't. I got plans.
A few of the guys get together.

44
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,859
- Did I do something wrong?
- What do you mean?

45
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,731
Well, I don't know exactly
what I mean...

46
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:06,894
...but I just think, like, when I come
here, you don't feel so comfortable.

47
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,289
And I certainly don't wanna do that.

48
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,721
- Well, you throw a big shadow.
- A big shadow?

49
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:16,509
You're not gonna get anything done
down here, Robert.

50
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:20,084
Well, if you're not gonna introduce me,
I will. Hi, I'm William Tomilson.

51
00:07:20,109 --> 00:07:22,398
- How you doing?
- Your son works for me.

52
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:24,614
- It's a good job.
- Yeah.

53
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:27,669
I've told Robert about 20 times
that I wanted to meet you.

54
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:29,971
You're pretty busy,
which isn't a bad thing.

55
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:32,556
- I get a little tied up.
- Grab a shot, will you?

56
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:36,426
I may not get this chance again.
Old warhorses have to stick together.

57
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,892
- The old horses, yeah.
- I'll tell you.

58
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:42,856
- Good thing it's not your left.
- This makes you popular with people.

59
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:46,196
- One, two, three.
- Finally, we get to meet.

60
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:49,084
I gotta get going. It was nice
to meet you face to face.

61
00:07:49,142 --> 00:07:52,654
You take care of yourself.
Robert, I'll see you later.

62
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:58,629
I gotta get going.
I'll change my plans for tonight.

63
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,598
That'd be great.
I'm looking forward to it.

64
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,183
- How you doing?
- Okay.

65
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,164
- Okay.
- All right.

66
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,807
And do not let those numbers
drive you crazy.

67
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:12,065
- Too late.
- Use an eraser, get rid of all of them.

68
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:15,284
- Yo, Rock.
- Hey, guys.

69
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:17,752
- Hey, Rock.
- Hey, how you doing?

70
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:34,155
There you go.

71
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:43,405
It'll be about 10 tenths.
You guys take care, okay? You got it.

72
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,685
I'll try a few of these later on.

73
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:52,076
- It's good for baking.
- How much...?

74
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:54,199
- Yo, Paul, what's the cost?
- 58.40, sir.

75
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:56,785
All right, take it out of that.
I trust you.

76
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:00,754
- How you doing?
- You're too generous.

77
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,659
Not a problem.

78
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:21,247
How you guys doing?

79
00:09:27,486 --> 00:09:29,670
How we doing, Isabel?

80
00:09:29,754 --> 00:09:32,257
Okay, except for the freebie
reading the Bible.

81
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:34,864
- He's okay.
- Just because you fought him...

82
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:37,954
...don't mean you gotta feed him.
He doesn't look like a fighter.

83
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:39,731
Spider Rico could hit.

84
00:09:39,832 --> 00:09:42,503
- Listen, how's your stomach?
- It's okay.

85
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:45,000
If you keep rubbing olive oil
on your stomach...

86
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:47,150
...your kid's gonna be
born very strong.

87
00:09:47,241 --> 00:09:50,232
- Okay, Rocky. Whatever you say.
- No, really.

88
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:55,687
- Yo, how you doing, Spider?
- God bless you, Rocky.

89
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:57,065
Thanks.

90
00:10:02,325 --> 00:10:04,402
How you guys doing?

91
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:10,162
Jose, can you make something special
for my kid who's coming tonight?

92
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,517
No problemo.

93
00:10:11,636 --> 00:10:14,863
Good. I appreciate it.

94
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:19,536
<i>Back and forth, back and forth,
give and take.</i>

95
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,984
And then I went in there like an animal
and threw him into the corner...

96
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:26,872
...and I unloaded everything I had.
Hook, hook, hook, left, left, left.

97
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:29,627
But Creed, he kept
busting me back pretty good...

98
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,707
...and the agony began to pile up.

99
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:35,233
Then I heard the best sound
that I ever heard in my life...

100
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:36,959
- The bell.
- That's right, the bell.

101
00:10:37,064 --> 00:10:40,364
I ain't never been so tired,
and I'm sitting in my corner.

102
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:43,142
I'm trying to figure out
how to survive the last round...

103
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:45,114
...when Mickey leans
into my ear and says:

104
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:48,434
"Come on, get out there
and fight this guy hard, you bum.

105
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:53,520
You gotta be first. You gotta be first."
I said, "Yo, Mick, if I could...

106
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:56,366
- "I would."
...I would."

107
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,773
The end.

108
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:27,787
<i>Yet another quick knockout for
Mason Dixon, almost perfunctory.</i>

109
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:30,599
<i>The fans let him know
how they feel about it.</i>

110
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,320
<i>They're actually pelting...</i>

111
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:37,219
<i>... the undefeated heavyweight
champion of the world with ice.</i>

112
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:45,512
Hello, Adrian's. Yeah?

113
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:50,428
Tell him you can't make it?
Yeah, I'll give him the message.

114
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:55,957
I just kept hearing Mickey's voice
in my head over and over again.

115
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:57,969
I just dug down,
and before you know it...

116
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:01,390
...it was toe to toe and it was...
Excuse me.

117
00:12:01,425 --> 00:12:05,840
Your son said he can't make it.
He said he'll take a rain check. Okay?

118
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:20,326
<i>Look at these birds.</i>

119
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,367
<i>Don't these birds look like candy?
Flying candy?</i>

120
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:25,399
<i>Hey, birdie,
you wanna fly me home?</i>

121
00:12:25,486 --> 00:12:28,119
You need somebody
to walk you home?

122
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:29,989
<i>No?</i>

123
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:35,239
It's a cold night. We need a few laughs
in our life. What do you think? Maybe?

124
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:37,775
<i>Maybe? Maybe?</i>

125
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:40,467
<i>Okay. Let's get out of here, okay?</i>

126
00:12:55,355 --> 00:12:57,894
That place ain't changed much
from last year.

127
00:12:57,956 --> 00:12:59,796
Are we done?

128
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,316
Hey, how you doing, Mick?

129
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:07,150
That sign is falling apart, Paulie.

130
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:10,710
The whole world is falling apart.
Look at us.

131
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:13,206
Don't talk crazy, Paulie.

132
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:18,835
You know, I think if you live someplace
long enough, you are that place.

133
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:21,885
I ain't no talking building.

134
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:24,312
Come on, it's getting late, Rocko.

135
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:27,368
I get a headache from this train.

136
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:50,170
I remember when
she was standing there...

137
00:13:50,216 --> 00:13:54,072
...all nervous and shy,
with this little smile.

138
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:57,889
And all I wanted her to do
was trust me.

139
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:03,149
She did.

140
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,671
- She did.
- You done?

141
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,038
- How long are we staying here?
- Not long.

142
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:27,556
Well, I'm glad they tore
this ice rink down.

143
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:28,907
Come on.

144
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:32,991
You heard me.
I'm happy they tore it apart.

145
00:14:36,468 --> 00:14:41,120
First time I walked your sister
across this ice, we was over there.

146
00:14:41,106 --> 00:14:44,750
She was nervous, but I wasn't so great
on the blades either.

147
00:14:44,778 --> 00:14:48,978
Ice is stupid. People standing on ice
are more stupid.

148
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:54,181
And over there,
when she was falling...

149
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:55,884
...and my hand grabbed her...

150
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,993
...and I got her arm through that coat,
I could feel it.

151
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,470
Electric.

152
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,439
You said the same thing
last year, Rock.

153
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:08,954
Did I?

154
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:11,362
- so you better develop your brain.

155
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:13,386
- You're left-handed.
- Absolutely.

156
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:15,874
Come on, Rock. Let's go.

157
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:22,179
We're done. There's no place
to sit down around here.

158
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,540
It's all right.

159
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:28,176
It ain't all right! It's depressing
and freaking cold!

160
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,424
What's the matter with you, Paulie?

161
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:32,912
You're living backwards, Rocko!

162
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:36,641
Change the channel from yesterday!
Yesterday wasn't so great!

163
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,172
- It was to me.
- Not to me!

164
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,240
You treated her good.
You had the good times.

165
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:48,692
I treated her bad.
I don't have to think about this.

166
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:52,207
She always loved you, Paulie.

167
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:59,832
Sorry, Rocko,
I can't do this no more.

168
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:13,754
Can I help you?

169
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:16,890
No, no, I used to come down
to this place a long time ago.

170
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:19,690
I was just looking around.
No big deal.

171
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:21,733
Can I get you a drink?

172
00:17:23,623 --> 00:17:27,100
- All right. Maybe just a short beer.
- Okay.

173
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:37,746
Go. Go on.

174
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,550
Yeah, go on.
Get him to buy a round.

175
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,624
Get him to buy a round. Go.

176
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:45,902
Get him to... He's got it.
He's spending money.

177
00:17:45,949 --> 00:17:51,372
Listen, I don't mean to cross the line
or anything...

178
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,442
...but I read about your wife's passing
a few years back.

179
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,116
Yeah, it was woman cancer.

180
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:59,323
Yeah. I always heard
she was a nice person.

181
00:17:59,364 --> 00:18:01,903
Yeah, the best.

182
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:05,303
- Do I know you?
- We met a long time ago.

183
00:18:05,704 --> 00:18:06,807
We did?

184
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:09,571
When I was a kid,
you walked me home.

185
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:13,048
- I did?
- Told me to stop smoking and things.

186
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:16,738
Stop smoking...

187
00:18:17,317 --> 00:18:20,996
Are you Little Marie that used to
hang out at that Atomic Hoagie shop?

188
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:22,932
Yeah, that's right.

189
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:25,959
Yeah, now I remember.
I walked you home.

190
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:30,063
When you got there, you turned
around and said, "Screw you, creepo."

191
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:32,498
- I didn't say that.
- Yeah, you did.

192
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:36,153
- You sure?
- Great insults last a long time.

193
00:18:36,172 --> 00:18:39,684
Yo! Yo, is that you?
Is that really you?

194
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,509
- How you doing?
- I think he wants to drink alone.

195
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:45,744
Well, then give him his drink, then.
I ain't stopping you.

196
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:49,401
What's that, your man or something?
No, I don't think so.

197
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:55,568
Anyway, me and my friends,
we're right down there.

198
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:59,035
Think you could buy us a round?
You got the money. Just one round.

199
00:18:59,065 --> 00:19:02,091
Hey. Thank you.

200
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:05,361
What are you doing
pushing my hand away like that?

201
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:07,910
- What's your name?
- Angie. What do you wanna know for?

202
00:19:07,975 --> 00:19:11,072
- Don't be playing a fool for that guy.
- A fool?

203
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:12,358
- Yeah.
- A fool?

204
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,577
I'm the fool? You're the fool, not me!

205
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:18,775
You got it twisted. You're the fool.
I'm a person, just like you.

206
00:19:18,854 --> 00:19:22,568
You ain't no better than me. You think
you're a big shot now? You're nothing.

207
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:26,590
You ain't no better than me.
No better!

208
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:29,417
Glad you dropped in?

209
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:32,309
I think the neighborhood
is changing a little.

210
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:35,917
- What was that all about?
- I don't know. Forget about it.

211
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:39,343
I'm gonna lock up, so if you wanna
take off, I'll tally everything up.

212
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,076
- Yeah, thanks.
- How you doing, Rock?

213
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,839
I'm good, thanks.

214
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,272
- You live around here?
- About eight blocks from here.

215
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,231
Eight blocks.

216
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,164
You need a lift?

217
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,672
All right.

218
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,638
Did you ever get married?

219
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,607
- Yeah, sort of.
- Sort of?

220
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,300
- Yeah, well, he took off.
- Poof, just like that?

221
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,590
Yeah, just like that.

222
00:20:05,941 --> 00:20:08,931
- You sort of have any kids?
- Yeah, I got one kid.

223
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,796
Yeah? Me too. Me too.
Wonderful boy.

224
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:16,636
Hey, tough guy! What's the matter,
you can't buy a round?

225
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:19,322
The girl was being nice
to your dumb ass.

226
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:22,165
- What you doing with that pig?
- Think you can disrespect us?

227
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:25,252
- She ain't nothing but a jealous bitch!
- Come on back!

228
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:27,335
Hey, don't listen to them.

229
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:30,588
Both of youse,
you ain't no better than me.

230
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:34,041
Come over here, you'll get
your head kicked in around here.

231
00:20:34,073 --> 00:20:38,309
- You punch-drunk, goofy bastard.
- You ain't no big shot, look at you.

232
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,380
You ain't even got a car
to take that pig home.

233
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,305
You all right?

234
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,820
Yeah.

235
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:54,343
What are you doing?
Don't get out. It's all right.

236
00:20:57,032 --> 00:21:00,366
No, Little Marie. It ain't all right.

237
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:06,848
- Yo.
- What?

238
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:09,028
I'll tell you what. Get inside.

239
00:21:09,113 --> 00:21:12,269
- You get inside. Yeah, you.
- Hey, leave him alone!

240
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:13,596
- Yo, man!
- See it?

241
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:16,006
- You see that? You see that?
- Yeah. All right.

242
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:18,518
- What do you say?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

243
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,323
Get a job!

244
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:38,362
That guy sends his apologies.

245
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:40,675
Okay.

246
00:21:57,434 --> 00:22:01,992
Martin. Martin. Yo, Martin!

247
00:22:06,645 --> 00:22:08,627
I see you still got your key.

248
00:22:08,712 --> 00:22:10,694
Yeah, I got a key.
You got time to talk?

249
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:14,127
I got a lot of time
since your people let me go.

250
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:16,583
You know I had
nothing to do with that.

251
00:22:16,655 --> 00:22:18,245
Yeah.

252
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:21,971
Yeah, we moved in
about a year ago.

253
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:24,493
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I mean, it's only temporary.

254
00:22:24,564 --> 00:22:27,589
- Yeah, I could see that.
- I'm gonna look for an apartment.

255
00:22:27,632 --> 00:22:29,294
Apartments are nice.

256
00:22:29,403 --> 00:22:31,206
Yeah. It is what it is, you know.

257
00:22:31,305 --> 00:22:33,286
Yeah, it is what it is.

258
00:22:33,373 --> 00:22:36,707
This place used to be pretty nice.
There's a lot of history around here.

259
00:22:36,744 --> 00:22:38,333
- Yeah.
- Like down the street...

260
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:40,107
...is the Cambria Fight Club.

261
00:22:40,216 --> 00:22:42,161
They used to call it
the Bucket of Blood.

262
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:45,656
I took some massive beatings there.
But it was nice. Good memories.

263
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:50,969
And I heard these buildings are like,
I don't know, 100, 150 years old.

264
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:56,208
If I was 150 years old, I'd be falling
apart too. So it's okay, building.

265
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,446
Does that light work?

266
00:22:57,569 --> 00:23:00,001
- No, it's burnt out or something. Yeah.
- Yeah?

267
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:07,100
Listen, thanks for the ride,
and I'm sorry about those guys.

268
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,793
Some of those guys just got their
brains on backwards and stuff.

269
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:13,807
- What's he doing out so late?
- Is that your kid?

270
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:16,071
Yeah. Wish he wouldn't
stay out so late.

271
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,209
- Amazing.
- Yeah, what's that?

272
00:23:19,693 --> 00:23:22,125
Last time I seen you,
you was a kid...

273
00:23:22,196 --> 00:23:24,451
...and now you officially
got one of your own.

274
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:25,670
It's amazing.

275
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:30,036
You know, he sort of resembles you.
He's got that big Irish hair.

276
00:23:30,772 --> 00:23:32,089
Yeah, it's the other one.

277
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,013
- Yeah?
- His father was from Jamaica.

278
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,468
Jamaica? European.

279
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:44,955
Was you on a cruise ship
or something?

280
00:23:45,021 --> 00:23:47,038
- No, not really.
- What's his name?

281
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:51,918
- Steps. Short for Stevenson.
- Makes sense.

282
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:58,565
Does he look mad at me, or is it
maybe the angle I'm standing at?

283
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,344
No. He's a good kid.

284
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:03,947
- You wanna meet him?
- It's getting kind of late.

285
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,758
- I got so many things to do.
- Yeah, yeah, I understand.

286
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:12,586
Thanks again for the ride
and everything else.

287
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:16,080
I'll see you.

288
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:18,652
You too.

289
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,865
Hey, Steps, come on. Let's go.
Say good night to your friend.

290
00:24:22,931 --> 00:24:25,470
What are you doing out
in the cold with no hat on?

291
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:28,001
- Did you get something to eat?
- Yeah, I already ate.

292
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,731
All right.

293
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,272
- You're late, you know.
- I can take care of myself.

294
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:35,027
Yo, Little Marie!

295
00:24:36,112 --> 00:24:38,164
Ain't you gonna
introduce me to your kid?

296
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:40,575
- How you doing, Steps?
- What's up?

297
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:46,074
Listen, I got this place, this restaurant,
nice little eatery not too far from here.

298
00:24:46,023 --> 00:24:48,076
What's all this junk? Got a tissue.

299
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,980
Sometimes I feel like a kangaroo,
all the stuff in my pocket, you know.

300
00:24:51,998 --> 00:24:54,216
Here you go.
I got a card, there it is.

301
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:56,448
And if you ever get a chance,
it'd be great...

302
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,490
...if both of youse
come down there and eat.

303
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:05,626
It'd be great, free. You know.
Anyway, I'll leave it over there... Here.

304
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,259
I'll leave it on the steps. Steps.

305
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:15,493
See you later.

306
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,404
Come on, let's go.

307
00:25:21,864 --> 00:25:24,261
<i>You've known what's best for you
since you were 10.</i>

308
00:25:24,334 --> 00:25:26,446
Since you walked in here alone.

309
00:25:27,336 --> 00:25:29,911
Got everything money can buy...

310
00:25:29,974 --> 00:25:32,122
...except what it can't.

311
00:25:32,842 --> 00:25:37,007
It's pride. Pride is what got
your ass out of here.

312
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:40,295
Losing is what brung you back.

313
00:25:41,788 --> 00:25:46,760
But people like you, they need
to be tested. Need a challenge.

314
00:25:46,725 --> 00:25:49,051
That ain't gonna happen.
Ain't nothing out there.

315
00:25:49,295 --> 00:25:52,843
There's always somebody
out there. Always.

316
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,528
When that time comes
and you find something...

317
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:58,176
...standing in front of you
that ain't running...

318
00:25:58,238 --> 00:26:03,840
...that ain't backing up, hitting on you,
and you're too damn tired to breathe...

319
00:26:03,978 --> 00:26:07,075
You find that situation on you,
that's good.

320
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:09,749
Because that's baptism under fire.

321
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:14,533
You get through that,
you find the only kind of respect...

322
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,323
...that matters in this damn world:

323
00:26:16,426 --> 00:26:18,680
Self-respect.

324
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:24,122
Thanks, Martin. I appreciate that.

325
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:26,006
Now, what can the champ
do for you?

326
00:26:27,271 --> 00:26:30,047
You can give me
some of that money you got.

327
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,846
- You know, I like you, Martin.
- But not that much.

328
00:26:34,847 --> 00:26:36,924
Exactly.

329
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,945
How about a picture with the kid?
All right?

330
00:26:43,021 --> 00:26:44,481
Sure.

331
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:49,277
Here, son, hold up your fist.
Makes you look more hazardous.

332
00:26:51,832 --> 00:26:53,148
- There you go.
- Thanks, Rock.

333
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:55,213
Enjoy your meal.

334
00:26:55,971 --> 00:26:57,631
- He's a nice guy, isn't he?
- Rocky?

335
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:59,957
- Yeah.
- Spider just went downstairs.

336
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:02,616
- I don't know if that's all right.
- What's he doing?

337
00:27:02,678 --> 00:27:05,039
I don't know. That's your friend.

338
00:27:11,053 --> 00:27:12,548
Yo, Spider!

339
00:27:12,656 --> 00:27:16,370
- Let me do some dishes. I feel better.
- Come on. You're my guest.

340
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:18,991
- Let me do something.
- Keep eating. Guests do that.

341
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:21,602
Don't make me fight you again.
Last time you got lucky.

342
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,081
Lucky? Okay.

343
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:25,863
Jesus wants me to work.

344
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:29,080
- Yo, Rocky.
- Yeah?

345
00:27:29,141 --> 00:27:30,280
You've got guests.

346
00:27:32,878 --> 00:27:34,682
Don't get too wet, okay?

347
00:27:36,016 --> 00:27:37,890
Glad Jesus didn't ask you to cook.

348
00:27:44,226 --> 00:27:45,959
You kept the card.

349
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,970
Yeah, I kept the card.

350
00:27:48,064 --> 00:27:50,497
- Why don't you sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

351
00:27:59,976 --> 00:28:04,734
Because, you know what, I walk in
there, I say good morning, I do this:

352
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,467
<i>Tonight, boxing once again.</i>

353
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,467
<i>Two contrasting styles
in almost every way.</i>

354
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,997
Hey, can you turn this up?
Turn this up, please.

355
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:16,536
<i>Who was the best of all time?
If two athletes from different eras...</i>

356
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:19,896
<i>... could compete against one another,
who would come out on top?</i>

357
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:23,896
<i>Given the same rules, using the same
equipment, who was the greatest?</i>

358
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,813
<i>We feed our facts
into the computer.</i>

359
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:28,408
<i>They weigh in on who they
think will reign supreme...</i>

360
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:31,737
<i>... while fielding the comments of our
illustrious panel of sportswriters.</i>

361
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:39,083
Champ!

362
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:42,119
- Yo, champ!
- Yeah?

363
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:45,285
Come check out this trash
they're talking about you, man!

364
00:28:45,327 --> 00:28:48,388
- What you talking about?
- Come check this out. Hurry up.

365
00:28:48,565 --> 00:28:51,033
<i>Tonight, the former two-time
heavyweight champion...</i>

366
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:53,213
<i>... from Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa.</i>

367
00:28:53,303 --> 00:28:55,355
<i>All right, Chuck Johnson,
USA Today?</i>

368
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:58,321
<i>There's no question that
Rocky Balboa fought tougher fights...</i>

369
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,000
<i>... during a tougher era in boxing.</i>

370
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:02,021
<i>You look at Mason Dixon
in his career...</i>

371
00:29:02,113 --> 00:29:04,510
<i>... he's basically been
spoon-fed his opponents.</i>

372
00:29:04,582 --> 00:29:06,872
<i>No question in my mind.
Not only does Rocky win...</i>

373
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:08,305
<i>... but he wins knockout.</i>

374
00:29:10,356 --> 00:29:12,053
Rocky!

375
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,391
Offspring.

376
00:29:15,662 --> 00:29:16,730
<i>Bernard Fernandez?</i>

377
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:18,703
<i>Dixon is a victim
of his own dominance.</i>

378
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,990
<i>He's never been in
real knockdown-dragout brawls.</i>

379
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:23,875
<i>He never had to dig down
to rally back.</i>

380
00:29:24,272 --> 00:29:26,253
<i>If he tries to dig down
against Balboa...</i>

381
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,879
<i>... he'll find he doesn't have
a big enough shovel.</i>

382
00:29:28,944 --> 00:29:31,898
<i>I clearly give it to Balboa.</i>

383
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:35,351
What happened to you?
What happened to you?

384
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:37,887
<i>Boxing historian
Burt Randolph Sugar.</i>

385
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:41,289
<i>Dixon has fought cream puffs.
We don't know what he's made of.</i>

386
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:43,544
<i>But both in their primes,
you gotta factor in...</i>

387
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:45,608
<i>... Dixon's unbelievable speed...</i>

388
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:48,437
<i>... his slashing offense.
He cuts Balboa to bits.</i>

389
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:51,453
<i>No doubt. Dixon wins all the way.</i>

390
00:29:52,638 --> 00:29:57,266
<i>Here's where our subjectivity ends.
Let's see what the computer says.</i>

391
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:02,214
<i>Dixon unloads on Balboa. Rocky has
no answer. Balboa is eating jabs.</i>

392
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:04,888
- What time is it?
- Mason time.

393
00:30:05,017 --> 00:30:07,758
- What time is it?
- Mason time.

394
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,075
- What time is it?
- Mason time.

395
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:23,019
<i>Now Dixon is done. He is reeling.
He is almost out on his feet!</i>

396
00:30:23,005 --> 00:30:25,639
<i>Balboa turning up the heat.
Pounds him across the ring.</i>

397
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:29,598
<i>Boy, he's bit off more than he
can chew this time. Believe it.</i>

398
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:33,087
<i>Oh, a murderous right hook!
And Dixon is out on his feet.</i>

399
00:30:33,348 --> 00:30:36,647
<i>He is out cold as he
crumbles to the canvas.</i>

400
00:30:36,686 --> 00:30:41,101
<i>And it is Balboa who has won...</i>

401
00:30:42,027 --> 00:30:44,945
Ladies and gentlemen, Baby Rocky.
Baby Rocky.

402
00:30:51,337 --> 00:30:55,965
I'm glad you liked the food. If you heat
that up, it's pretty good in the morning.

403
00:30:57,044 --> 00:30:58,575
Yeah, thanks, man.

404
00:30:59,047 --> 00:31:02,903
Nice kid. I hope this music ain't giving
you a headache. I like this old stuff.

405
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,170
No, I like it. It's nice.

406
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,631
Well, good. Good.

407
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:21,380
Yo, you think Steps wants a job?
Make a few bucks on the weekend?

408
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:25,156
It's good making your own G's. My kid
stashed a few bucks doing that.

409
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:27,379
Why are you being so nice?

410
00:31:28,546 --> 00:31:30,835
I don't want you to think
nothing's off, you know.

411
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:34,215
My wife, she's gone, but she ain't.
You know what I mean?

412
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:36,434
Yeah, well, I wasn't thinking that.
Believe me.

413
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:39,263
- No? Then what was you thinking?
- No.

414
00:31:39,324 --> 00:31:41,863
That you don't owe us nothing.
What are you doing?

415
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:43,731
Be patient.

416
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,384
Now...

417
00:31:45,866 --> 00:31:49,971
...I don't owe you nothing,
but why do you gotta...

418
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,755
...owe something to get...?

419
00:31:54,574 --> 00:31:55,855
Bingo.

420
00:32:01,116 --> 00:32:05,637
Why do you gotta owe something
to get something, you know? Really.

421
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:12,216
I think hanging out with your kid
would be nice. What do you think?

422
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:14,518
I think that'd be nice.

423
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:19,082
Good. That's very nice.

424
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:21,391
I'm glad you come by.

425
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:25,214
It was nice watching you eat.

426
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:28,852
Good company.

427
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:34,487
Yo, Little Marie. Let there be light!

428
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:47,579
- You like dogs?
- Dogs?

429
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:52,532
Dogs. This is like a dog pound.
It's where they keep...

430
00:32:52,808 --> 00:32:57,709
...a large variety of dogs. I used to
come here all the time for sightseeing.

431
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,263
But, you know,
you learn a lot talking to dogs.

432
00:33:01,284 --> 00:33:04,891
- Really, you do.
- Yeah, man. So...

433
00:33:04,921 --> 00:33:07,519
Hey, man, how about this one?

434
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:10,862
He don't look too friendly, my friend.

435
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:13,774
Man, this is the one.
Hey, boy, how you doing?

436
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:17,237
Hey, what about this one here?
Come here, boy.

437
00:33:17,267 --> 00:33:18,821
- Who, him?
- Yeah, why not?

438
00:33:18,936 --> 00:33:21,191
Hell, no. That is one ugly dog, man.

439
00:33:21,273 --> 00:33:25,794
I know, but it's kind of a cute ugly.
If you look at it closely, the color...

440
00:33:25,778 --> 00:33:29,777
...it looks like old furniture, like some
kind of pirate-chest thing going on.

441
00:33:29,782 --> 00:33:32,321
Yeah, sure, man.
Hey, so how about a young one?

442
00:33:32,384 --> 00:33:36,028
Steps, forget him. Come over here.
I want you to see something.

443
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:40,612
Now, you notice what this animal
is doing here? Lying in that position?

444
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:41,876
He ain't doing nothing.

445
00:33:41,996 --> 00:33:44,844
No, he's doing a lot.
He ain't wasting no energy.

446
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,109
Because he's dead.

447
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:55,368
He ain't dead. There's a lot of
good mileage left on that animal.

448
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:59,646
Good food, the addition of a couple
of new friends, bingo, he's back.

449
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:03,234
- What do you think is a good name?
- It's your dog. You name him.

450
00:34:03,254 --> 00:34:05,960
No. It's, like,
a community animal. Fifty-fifty.

451
00:34:06,024 --> 00:34:08,598
Look, I don't know much
about no dogs.

452
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,356
Well, it ain't that complicated.

453
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:14,212
You pet him, you feed him,
and nature takes its course.

454
00:34:14,266 --> 00:34:17,222
You know, so...
Don't you wanna name an animal?

455
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:21,471
Every guy should at one time
try to name an animal something.

456
00:34:21,806 --> 00:34:23,301
I don't know. Fleabag?

457
00:34:24,044 --> 00:34:28,280
It's catchy. It ain't original,
but it's pretty good.

458
00:34:28,282 --> 00:34:30,786
I think you could come up with,
in your young brain...

459
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,971
...something better to throw out
than Fleabag.

460
00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:36,599
Punchy. How's that?

461
00:34:38,028 --> 00:34:40,531
- Punchy?
- Yeah, Punchy.

462
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,311
- I like it, you know.
- For real?

463
00:34:46,403 --> 00:34:51,862
Yeah, for real. Punchy it is. It's easy to
remember, it's not that hard to spell.

464
00:34:51,807 --> 00:34:55,355
And once it's in your brain, you never
forget it. Punchy. Very good.

465
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:58,154
- All right, man.
- Good call.

466
00:34:58,215 --> 00:35:01,515
All right, Punchy. You ready
to get bailed out, my friend?

467
00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:03,598
Okay.

468
00:35:04,623 --> 00:35:06,568
Hey, you know
it was a joke, don't you?

469
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:09,542
Yeah, I know.
You're a very funny guy.

470
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:45,930
Rocky?

471
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:49,056
<i>The fans let him know
how they feel about it.</i>

472
00:35:49,141 --> 00:35:51,503
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

473
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:55,515
<i>This could get ugly.</i>

474
00:35:56,149 --> 00:35:57,703
- Rock.
- Yo, Paulie.

475
00:35:57,815 --> 00:36:00,877
They're gonna be talking about
that fake Looney Tune fight.

476
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:04,301
Hey, come on. We're about
to serve today's special.

477
00:36:04,358 --> 00:36:07,965
Italian food cooked up by a bunch
of Mexicans ain't so special.

478
00:36:07,995 --> 00:36:10,012
Hey, yo.

479
00:36:11,265 --> 00:36:12,925
Hey, I skipped work for this.

480
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:19,476
What an ugly dog.

481
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,032
It's a cute dog.

482
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:25,527
- Hey, Rock.
- Yeah?

483
00:36:25,648 --> 00:36:28,674
I'm gonna take off.
That stuff back there is pretty cool.

484
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:30,175
- Oh, you like that?
- Yeah, man.

485
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:32,979
- Thanks, I appreciate it.
- I'll catch you later.

486
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,932
All right.

487
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,753
- Who's the criminal?
- He's a nice kid.

488
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,565
He dresses like a bum.

489
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:46,605
Coming from a human hamper,
that's quite a compliment.

490
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,526
Hide the silverware.

491
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:51,268
That's nice.

492
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:54,320
Hey, Spider.

493
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:01,448
Didn't you knock out
that bum once?

494
00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:03,575
Will you give it a rest?

495
00:37:13,903 --> 00:37:17,343
I'm gonna be late for work for this.
Give me a break, huh?

496
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,323
All right. Just for a few seconds.

497
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:23,711
<i>In the late '60s, a simulated fight
took place between two legends...</i>

498
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,283
<i>... Muhammad Ali
and Rocky Marciano.</i>

499
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:30,277
<i>Marciano long retired,
and Ali unable to fight legitimately...</i>

500
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:33,798
<i>... for three years for having refused
induction into the armed forces...</i>

501
00:37:33,823 --> 00:37:36,742
<i>... was in need of money,
and agreed to the dream match...</i>

502
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:39,465
<i>... whose outcome would be
decided by a computer.</i>

503
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:41,858
<i>It's almost 35 years
since Rocky Marciano...</i>

504
00:37:41,932 --> 00:37:44,401
<i>... won the much-disputed
computer decision...</i>

505
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:47,282
<i>... and guess what?
Not much has changed.</i>

506
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,630
<i>Last week, Rocky Balboa
won a decisive fight...</i>

507
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,866
See? That's the cartoon fight
I'm telling you about.

508
00:37:52,913 --> 00:37:54,443
Yeah.

509
00:37:54,548 --> 00:37:56,078
<i>A stunning knockout.</i>

510
00:37:56,184 --> 00:37:58,924
<i>Keep in mind, this is taking
the human factor out of it.</i>

511
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,894
<i>- The computer says Balboa...
- Beautiful.</i>

512
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:05,997
<i>... would be triumphant, KO 13.
And here's some of the fallout:</i>

513
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,250
<i>What started as a simple
form of entertainment...</i>

514
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,727
<i>... has become a rallying cry
for people who think...</i>

515
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,684
<i>... an old-school athlete like Balboa
could actually be better.</i>

516
00:38:13,736 --> 00:38:17,627
<i>Computer technology has to create
what isn't. That's just not responsible.</i>

517
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:19,694
Get therapy, will you?

518
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:22,410
<i>How do you think Balboa
would have done against Dixon?</i>

519
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:25,780
<i>Badly. Personally, I think Balboa
was completely overrated.</i>

520
00:38:25,816 --> 00:38:27,726
<i>He owns a restaurant
in South Philly.</i>

521
00:38:27,818 --> 00:38:29,871
<i>What's the specialty,
pounded chicken?</i>

522
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:33,562
<i>Anyway, I would have paid to see
the fight. Next topic, NAS CAR...</i>

523
00:38:33,592 --> 00:38:35,574
<i>... and the controversy
that won't go away.</i>

524
00:38:35,662 --> 00:38:38,165
<i>Let's go back to Sunday's race...</i>

525
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,963
Hey, hey, hey, cheer up.

526
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:43,745
It's free advertisement.
Come on. Meat house calls.

527
00:38:53,615 --> 00:38:55,490
Yo, Robert.

528
00:38:57,954 --> 00:38:59,614
What are you doing out so late?

529
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:02,391
I tried calling,
but nothing was picking up.

530
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:04,783
- Is something wrong?
- I just wanted to come by...

531
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,937
...and see you in person.
- Wanna come inside?

532
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:09,948
No. I just wanna get
your opinion on something.

533
00:39:10,466 --> 00:39:11,996
Sure. Opinion on what?

534
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,570
You know, they say you only
go around once, right?

535
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:16,965
- Yeah, I've heard that.
- Well...

536
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:19,639
...I think I wanna, like,
do something.

537
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:22,737
- Like what?
- Fight.

538
00:39:23,414 --> 00:39:27,165
You know, nothing big.
Small stuff, like locally. You know.

539
00:39:28,922 --> 00:39:31,877
Don't you think you're too,
you know, old?

540
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:34,310
You think you ought to
stop trying things...

541
00:39:34,395 --> 00:39:36,970
...because you had a few
too many birthdays? I do not.

542
00:39:37,031 --> 00:39:38,526
People will think you're crazy.

543
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:42,702
What's crazy about standing
toe to toe saying, "I am," you know?

544
00:39:42,803 --> 00:39:44,393
That's just ego talking.

545
00:39:45,873 --> 00:39:48,650
What are you trying to prove
to other people, Pop?

546
00:39:49,546 --> 00:39:52,144
Prove? Listen, I stopped thinking...

547
00:39:52,214 --> 00:39:54,397
...the way other people think
a long time ago.

548
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:56,252
You gotta think like you think.

549
00:39:58,022 --> 00:40:01,914
- I do.
- Do you? Good.

550
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:06,684
You gotta face reality, okay?
It's a different world now.

551
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:09,833
Only the clothes is different.

552
00:40:11,736 --> 00:40:14,857
I really don't know
what you want from me.

553
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:20,281
I just wanted us to get involved.
You know, like, home team.

554
00:40:22,114 --> 00:40:27,810
Look, whatever it is, whatever
you're going through, it'll pass.

555
00:40:27,787 --> 00:40:29,864
Yeah, you're probably right.

556
00:40:29,956 --> 00:40:32,627
Time is gonna catch up to all of us.

557
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,166
- Especially if you're standing still.
- Hey, come on.

558
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,296
Look, I'm gonna call you
in the morning.

559
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,715
<i>- Did you tell this to your kid?
- Yeah, I did.</i>

560
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:49,030
<i>- What'd he think, you're nuts, right?
- Yeah.</i>

561
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:55,092
Oh, well, he don't believe in you?
Welcome to my world, buddy.

562
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,389
Rocko, nobody's giving you
no title shot.

563
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:00,926
I know that. I don't want one.

564
00:41:00,993 --> 00:41:03,496
So this isn't a mental disturbance?

565
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:05,987
No.

566
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,252
You're mad because
they took down your statue?

567
00:41:09,736 --> 00:41:11,645
No.

568
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:14,031
Not really, no.

569
00:41:14,173 --> 00:41:19,490
If it's about money, just hang a sign
around your neck saying, "Punch me."

570
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:22,543
Five dollars, you'll make big money.

571
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:26,657
What? You haven't peaked yet?

572
00:41:27,456 --> 00:41:29,959
- Peaked?
- Yeah, peaked.

573
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:32,890
I don't know. There's still
some stuff in the basement.

574
00:41:33,863 --> 00:41:36,710
- What basement?
- In here.

575
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:39,166
Tell me about the stuff.

576
00:41:40,403 --> 00:41:43,988
- What about it?
- Tell me about the stuff inside.

577
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:46,546
- Is it angry?
- Angry?

578
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:48,795
Are you mad because
Adrian left you?

579
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:51,585
She didn't leave, Paulie. She died.

580
00:41:51,649 --> 00:41:53,524
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

581
00:41:57,957 --> 00:42:01,849
You know, sometimes
it's hard to breathe.

582
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,751
You know, I feel, like,
this beast inside me.

583
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,676
It's okay, Rocko. Please, it's okay.

584
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:12,284
Is it okay?

585
00:42:17,478 --> 00:42:21,229
I just never knew it was
supposed to be this hard.

586
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:24,345
It wasn't supposed to be like this,
Paulie. You know, it...

587
00:42:34,197 --> 00:42:36,451
So you wanna come by
and help me train?

588
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:38,028
I got a job here.

589
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:40,027
I understand.

590
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:43,396
Remember you said if you stay
one place long enough...

591
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:44,829
...you become that place?

592
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:47,804
Rocko, this is all I got.

593
00:42:48,147 --> 00:42:50,780
I understand, Paulie. I do.

594
00:42:55,254 --> 00:42:59,419
If you get time and come down
and see me train, I'd appreciate it.

595
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:02,304
Of course, Rocko.

596
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:07,135
Bye, Paulie.

597
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:07,754
Goodbye, Rocko.

598
00:43:07,736 --> 00:43:09,433
Goodbye, Rocko.

599
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:14,151
Take care, Rocko.

600
00:43:19,381 --> 00:43:23,167
<i>This plenary session of the
Pennsylvania Athletic Commission...</i>

601
00:43:23,186 --> 00:43:28,989
...is convened in order to consider
the application of Rocky Balboa...

602
00:43:28,925 --> 00:43:33,340
...for the issuance of a discretionary
professional boxing license...

603
00:43:33,332 --> 00:43:38,339
...due to his ineligibility to be
licensed as a matter of right.

604
00:43:38,302 --> 00:43:42,432
Mr. Balboa, you're welcome here.
Since you're representing yourself...

605
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,704
...we invite you to make an opening
statement, if you'd like to.

606
00:43:45,745 --> 00:43:48,415
No, I was just curious how I did,
that's all.

607
00:43:48,482 --> 00:43:53,205
All right, well, the Medical
Advisory Board has informed us...

608
00:43:53,186 --> 00:43:56,248
...that the battery of tests
to which you've been subjected...

609
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:59,697
...you've passed these tests
with flying colors.

610
00:43:59,793 --> 00:44:02,427
And we congratulate you for that.

611
00:44:02,498 --> 00:44:05,524
- Thanks.
- However, this commission...

612
00:44:05,568 --> 00:44:09,496
...in good conscience,
cannot recommend you for a license...

613
00:44:09,738 --> 00:44:13,073
...and we therefore deny
your application.

614
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:17,196
- Didn't I do what you asked?
- Yes, you did.

615
00:44:17,248 --> 00:44:19,015
So I should get a license, right?

616
00:44:19,284 --> 00:44:20,529
Not exactly.

617
00:44:23,487 --> 00:44:27,166
So why did you give me all them tests
if you was never passing me?

618
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:29,244
We've gotta stand by
our decision here...

619
00:44:29,328 --> 00:44:32,841
...and we have to deny your request
for a license at this time.

620
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:47,685
Yo, don't I got some rights?

621
00:44:47,748 --> 00:44:49,931
What rights do you think
you're referring to?

622
00:44:50,018 --> 00:44:52,794
Like in that official paper
they wrote down the street?

623
00:44:52,853 --> 00:44:54,871
- That's the Bill of Rights.
- Bill of Rights.

624
00:44:54,956 --> 00:44:57,283
Don't it say something about going
after what makes you happy?

625
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,242
No, that's "the pursuit of happiness."
But what's your point?

626
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:03,702
My point is I'm pursuing something,
and nobody looks too happy about it.

627
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:06,334
But we're just looking out
for your interests.

628
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:10,224
I appreciate that, but maybe you're
looking out for your interests more.

629
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:13,718
You shouldn't ask people to come here
and pay the freight on something.

630
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:17,044
They pay, it still ain't good enough.
You think that's right?

631
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:20,487
Maybe you're doing your job, but why
you gotta stop me from doing mine?

632
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:24,920
If you're willing to go through all the
battling to get where you want to get...

633
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:26,727
...who's got the right to stop you?

634
00:45:26,826 --> 00:45:30,410
Maybe you got something you never
finished, something you wanna do.

635
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,756
Something you never said
to somebody, something!

636
00:45:32,832 --> 00:45:35,051
And you're told no,
even after you pay your dues.

637
00:45:35,136 --> 00:45:37,842
Who's got the right
to tell you that? Who? Nobody!

638
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:41,204
It's your right to listen to your gut.
It's nobody's right to say no...

639
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:44,790
...after you earn the right to be what you
wanna be or do what you wanna do!

640
00:45:48,884 --> 00:45:53,157
The older I get, the more things
I gotta leave behind. That's life.

641
00:45:53,156 --> 00:45:57,914
The only thing I'm asking you guys
to leave on the table is what's right.

642
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:17,020
Yo! Have you seen
the paper today?

643
00:46:17,116 --> 00:46:19,334
Front row. Front row.

644
00:46:20,586 --> 00:46:21,690
That is so great.

645
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:24,453
- All right, all right.
- Let's go get some food. Food.

646
00:46:24,524 --> 00:46:28,523
- Let's get a beer. Come on.
- Come on.

647
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:30,978
The last two pay-per-views
were in the toilet.

648
00:46:31,065 --> 00:46:33,771
You're not making
heavyweight-championship money.

649
00:46:33,835 --> 00:46:35,888
There's a bunch of nobodies
out there, Mase.

650
00:46:35,969 --> 00:46:39,126
I wanna talk to you about an
opportunity we should run with.

651
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:43,173
Look at me. You heard Rocky Balboa
applied for a license and got one?

652
00:46:43,177 --> 00:46:45,159
- I heard. Forget about him.
- Hear me out.

653
00:46:45,248 --> 00:46:48,760
You want me to fight a guy I can beat
with both hands tied behind my back.

654
00:46:48,785 --> 00:46:52,297
Everybody knows you could beat him
sitting down. That's not what it's about.

655
00:46:52,323 --> 00:46:55,729
It's about making money. We gotta
capitalize on that computer fight.

656
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,608
This could do a million buys.
That's 15, 20 million to you.

657
00:46:58,662 --> 00:47:00,739
- Forget it.
- No one's beating the door down...

658
00:47:00,832 --> 00:47:03,608
...to watch you fight anymore.
- We got guaranteed fights.

659
00:47:03,669 --> 00:47:06,766
You wanna do this now in front
of your friends, we'll do it now.

660
00:47:06,805 --> 00:47:10,412
We got nothing. All the pay-per-view
fights you come up with got rejected.

661
00:47:10,443 --> 00:47:14,121
You know why? They're all bums
out there. Nobody cares about them.

662
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:18,272
There's no marquee value.
But this Balboa thing is interesting.

663
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,044
- I don't wanna do it.
- Listen to me.

664
00:47:20,155 --> 00:47:24,225
It's a has-been, never-gonna-be world.
Call it nostalgia, whatever you want...

665
00:47:24,225 --> 00:47:27,560
...but people relate to that stuff.
This is a no-lose. It's all good.

666
00:47:27,897 --> 00:47:30,602
- Good for who?
- For you! Not for me! For you!

667
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:33,895
Maybe you don't understand.
People don't like you no more.

668
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:37,545
They don't follow you. They're not
supporting you anymore. Understand?

669
00:47:37,575 --> 00:47:39,793
Don't look at me like
I'm messing with your legacy.

670
00:47:39,874 --> 00:47:41,678
Every jock now thinks
they got a legacy.

671
00:47:41,778 --> 00:47:44,840
A legacy is what you get instead
of getting paid. That's a legacy.

672
00:47:44,881 --> 00:47:47,552
- Don't talk to me like I'm stupid.
- I'm not no more.

673
00:47:47,617 --> 00:47:51,332
Everybody knows you could kick
this old man's ass. But you don't.

674
00:47:51,355 --> 00:47:53,468
Leave him with a little
dignity, so they say:

675
00:47:53,558 --> 00:47:57,200
"Mason Dixon's got compassion.
He's a decent guy, he's a nice guy."

676
00:47:57,229 --> 00:47:59,732
You get a whole new audience,
we'll double your money.

677
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:01,946
You want a new image?
That's how you get it.

678
00:48:02,035 --> 00:48:03,839
To replace the one
that you two made?

679
00:48:03,937 --> 00:48:06,892
Whoa, wait. We made your
world green. You made the rest.

680
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,993
This is you.
You made all this junk happen.

681
00:48:09,076 --> 00:48:10,845
I've had it up to here with this mess.

682
00:48:10,946 --> 00:48:13,544
Time for me to make changes.
I'm going to Martin's gym.

683
00:48:13,615 --> 00:48:15,418
- We'll talk about it.
- Forget this crap.

684
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,984
I want Martin back.
There's nothing to talk about.

685
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,438
- How you doing?
- Hey, what a surprise.

686
00:48:30,535 --> 00:48:33,038
I was driving around
the neighborhood, I thought...

687
00:48:33,103 --> 00:48:35,844
...why not drive by and say hello?
- You wanna come inside?

688
00:48:35,906 --> 00:48:39,063
No, the dog needs some exercise.
You wanna take a little walk?

689
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,613
- Yeah, yeah. All right.
- It's nice outside.

690
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:44,350
- All right.
- Nice and brisk.

691
00:48:44,415 --> 00:48:45,660
When did you get a dog?

692
00:48:45,783 --> 00:48:47,967
We picked up Punchy
a couple of days back.

693
00:48:48,054 --> 00:48:49,299
- Punchy?
- Yeah.

694
00:48:49,422 --> 00:48:50,703
You named your dog Punchy?

695
00:48:50,823 --> 00:48:52,591
Your kid come up with the name.

696
00:48:52,692 --> 00:48:55,231
Oh, yeah?
I think that's disrespectful.

697
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,133
Oh, no, no. It's fine, really.

698
00:48:57,230 --> 00:49:00,670
No, it's easy to remember
and it's all that, you know.

699
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:03,821
Listen, what do you think about
coming over to the restaurant?

700
00:49:03,871 --> 00:49:07,028
- What for?
- Well, you know, for, like...

701
00:49:07,075 --> 00:49:10,659
For work. The hostess is gonna
be having a kid. You'd do good.

702
00:49:10,678 --> 00:49:13,312
- I don't know.
- I'm telling you, you'd do so good.

703
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,957
I appreciate what you're doing
for my kid, but I can't.

704
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,594
Hey, listen, I think you'd like it a lot.

705
00:49:18,654 --> 00:49:21,193
It's a nice environment,
it's very pleasant.

706
00:49:21,257 --> 00:49:23,404
Yeah, can we drop it?

707
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,350
What's bothering you?

708
00:49:27,463 --> 00:49:29,790
Nothing. It's all right.
Listen, I gotta get back.

709
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:33,153
- No, it ain't all right.
- Oh, come on.

710
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:35,350
- What?
- I'm gonna be the first person...

711
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,979
...people see when they walk in?
- You give out menus.

712
00:49:38,044 --> 00:49:40,926
You say, "Hello, how are you?"
You sit people down.

713
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,341
Look, if I can do it,
anybody can do it.

714
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:46,821
You could find 10 better people,
a hundred better people for this job.

715
00:49:46,853 --> 00:49:48,763
Give it a try, like two weeks.

716
00:49:48,856 --> 00:49:50,730
I don't wanna try.

717
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:53,150
- Who put this stuff in your head?
- Nobody.

718
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:55,303
Well, it just don't
get in there by itself.

719
00:49:58,801 --> 00:50:00,819
Thanks for coming by.

720
00:50:02,638 --> 00:50:07,326
Yo, when was the last time you
went dancing? Has it been a while?

721
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:09,254
- Why are you asking?
- I'm asking because...

722
00:50:09,346 --> 00:50:12,751
...you dance around these problems,
you might as well dance with me.

723
00:50:12,782 --> 00:50:15,938
I ain't that good,
but I'm better than the average bear.

724
00:50:15,987 --> 00:50:18,763
Where that came from, I don't know.

725
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,820
- You're crazy.
- A little bit.

726
00:50:20,925 --> 00:50:24,331
But the way you're thinking
and talking, it's a little crazy too.

727
00:50:25,062 --> 00:50:28,848
Come on, you deserve better.
Really. Come on over.

728
00:50:28,868 --> 00:50:33,282
I need you to class my place up.
Philly needs you.

729
00:50:33,472 --> 00:50:37,293
And if you say, "Screw you, creepo"
again, I totally understand.

730
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:39,848
But I'm warning you,
I'm gonna put myself...

731
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:41,858
...in the middle of the street here...

732
00:50:41,949 --> 00:50:45,010
...and stand here, me and Punchy,
and wave to the first bus, say:

733
00:50:45,052 --> 00:50:46,856
"Come on over here and mash me!

734
00:50:46,954 --> 00:50:49,528
Little Marie turned down
the job at the restaurant.

735
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:51,358
She thinks she's better than us."

736
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:54,864
Oh, yeah? Well, there hasn't been
a bus down here in 20 years.

737
00:50:55,364 --> 00:50:57,441
- Yeah?
- No.

738
00:50:59,435 --> 00:51:01,132
That was a close call.

739
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:07,348
Listen, seriously. Come on over.
It'd be nice.

740
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:11,276
All right.

741
00:51:29,469 --> 00:51:31,094
Paulie!

742
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:36,249
Sorry, Paulie.

743
00:51:37,579 --> 00:51:39,347
Sorry.

744
00:52:10,548 --> 00:52:13,811
How are you?
Get my unusual up there.

745
00:52:13,852 --> 00:52:16,736
Excuse me.
Deliveries are in the back.

746
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,559
I'm not a delivery guy.

747
00:52:18,657 --> 00:52:20,531
Well, do you have a reservation?

748
00:52:20,628 --> 00:52:23,475
Do I look like a freaking Indian?

749
00:52:26,334 --> 00:52:28,730
Hey, Rock? Rocky?

750
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:36,424
I think we've got a little bit
of a problem with this guy.

751
00:52:36,477 --> 00:52:38,910
Problem?
No, no, he's just a relative.

752
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:41,343
Oh, okay.

753
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:45,281
Yo, Paulie.

754
00:52:47,491 --> 00:52:49,567
- What happened to your eye?
- I hit it.

755
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,667
- Why?
- Needed to.

756
00:52:52,229 --> 00:52:53,618
What happened?

757
00:52:53,731 --> 00:52:56,578
- I'm celebrating, Rock.
- Why?

758
00:52:56,636 --> 00:52:59,174
- I retired.
- Retired?

759
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,616
So when did they start
giving retired people meat...

760
00:53:07,681 --> 00:53:09,934
...instead of watches, Paulie?

761
00:53:12,652 --> 00:53:14,705
I don't need a watch.

762
00:53:16,455 --> 00:53:20,003
I got a watch! You gave me a watch!

763
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,377
Paulie...

764
00:53:21,495 --> 00:53:24,129
I don't need no goddamn watch.

765
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:28,929
- Yo, Paulie.
- I got a watch!

766
00:53:30,105 --> 00:53:32,182
I got two watches!

767
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:34,830
Yo, Paulie!

768
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:48,159
Yo, Paulie.

769
00:53:49,761 --> 00:53:51,316
Rock.

770
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:56,155
It takes guts climbing back in that ring,
knowing you're gonna take a beating.

771
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,652
You're gonna do all right, Rocko.

772
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:02,229
How do you know that?

773
00:54:04,078 --> 00:54:06,748
The stuff in the basement.

774
00:54:17,626 --> 00:54:19,429
Thanks, Paulie.

775
00:54:24,167 --> 00:54:27,192
- Hey.
- Hey, Rock, how are you?

776
00:54:28,438 --> 00:54:30,656
- You okay?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

777
00:54:30,741 --> 00:54:32,439
- Yeah, fine. This is great.
- Good.

778
00:54:32,543 --> 00:54:35,319
Listen, some guys over there
wanna talk to you.

779
00:54:35,379 --> 00:54:38,298
- Okay. You got it.
- Okay?

780
00:54:41,619 --> 00:54:44,432
- Thanks for coming by. I appreciate it.
- Our pleasure.

781
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,567
- Wanna hear stories?
- What kind of stories?

782
00:54:46,692 --> 00:54:49,504
Well, a lot of people like to hear
these old fight stories.

783
00:54:49,562 --> 00:54:51,092
- Maybe later.
- Okay.

784
00:54:51,196 --> 00:54:55,848
I'm Lou DiBella. This is L.C. Luco.
He's Mason Dixon's manager.

785
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:58,374
- Will you sit down and join us?
- Sure.

786
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,758
You know, we have the promotional
contract for Mason Dixon...

787
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:04,400
...who's a big fan.
- Really?

788
00:55:04,512 --> 00:55:06,731
When he heard you were
interested in fighting...

789
00:55:06,815 --> 00:55:09,142
...he thought why not try
to work something out?

790
00:55:09,217 --> 00:55:12,373
Like a special event.
Like a first-class exhibition fight.

791
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,973
- Why me?
- He respects the hell out of you.

792
00:55:16,058 --> 00:55:20,188
All right? And let's be honest,
that computer fight got people curious.

793
00:55:20,196 --> 00:55:22,735
- This could be very interesting.
- I ain't interested...

794
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,019
...in getting, like,
mangled and embarrassed.

795
00:55:25,102 --> 00:55:27,356
No, that's not gonna happen.
Never happen.

796
00:55:27,438 --> 00:55:31,782
Truthfully, I was thinking
more on a, like...

797
00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:35,760
...miniscule, small level.
You know. Small fights, not big fights.

798
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,986
Small fights. Things that...
Local. You know what I mean?

799
00:55:39,985 --> 00:55:43,664
Not a bad idea. Don't think of it as big.
Think of it like an exhibition.

800
00:55:43,689 --> 00:55:47,403
Think of it as a glorified sparring
session. Here's something you'll like.

801
00:55:47,426 --> 00:55:50,060
We're gonna donate a portion
of the gate to charity.

802
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:52,314
- That's always nice.
- It's good to give.

803
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,930
Yeah.

804
00:55:54,303 --> 00:55:55,963
Where's it taking place?

805
00:55:56,071 --> 00:55:57,495
- Las Vegas.
- Las Vegas.

806
00:55:57,606 --> 00:56:00,976
Nice and warm.
This cold's gotta be killing you.

807
00:56:01,043 --> 00:56:03,510
- Little stiff.
- You move better when you're warmer.

808
00:56:04,011 --> 00:56:05,709
- Yeah.
- And if nothing else...

809
00:56:05,814 --> 00:56:07,997
...you'll have new stories to tell.

810
00:56:08,184 --> 00:56:11,139
- I really gotta think about this.
- Absolutely.

811
00:56:11,188 --> 00:56:13,691
- Is that okay?
- I understand. No problem.

812
00:56:13,958 --> 00:56:16,247
I'm gonna go over there.
You can order something.

813
00:56:16,326 --> 00:56:18,510
- What do you recommend?
- It's all edible.

814
00:56:21,332 --> 00:56:24,037
Okay. Thanks.

815
00:56:24,536 --> 00:56:28,536
We got him. Imagine if Dixon
met this bastard in his prime?

816
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,114
- He'd kill him. Kill him.
- You ain't kidding.

817
00:56:31,544 --> 00:56:34,012
Man, I'm confused.

818
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:43,102
I didn't think this was gonna
come along.

819
00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:44,888
But this is what you wanted, right?

820
00:56:44,992 --> 00:56:47,390
I don't know.
You know, I talk and I talk.

821
00:56:47,462 --> 00:56:49,645
Sometimes I think
what I'm saying is true...

822
00:56:49,731 --> 00:56:54,252
...and then I look at myself and I'm
not even sure what is true anymore.

823
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:57,357
Because it's like, I pushed
this crazy idea about fighting.

824
00:56:57,406 --> 00:56:59,031
I mean, what's it all about?

825
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:02,202
Do I really care about standing
toe to toe and all that stuff...

826
00:57:02,246 --> 00:57:05,995
...or, like my kid says,
is it just, like, ego?

827
00:57:06,016 --> 00:57:09,945
Or am I this old pug who's just trying
to replace old pain with new pain?

828
00:57:09,953 --> 00:57:12,659
I don't know. I don't know.

829
00:57:14,325 --> 00:57:17,209
Look, I know
I usually don't say a lot.

830
00:57:17,262 --> 00:57:21,498
I'm always listening and looking.

831
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:26,650
But who you are, the part of you
that's so full of life...

832
00:57:26,606 --> 00:57:28,753
...we all have that feeling, that fire...

833
00:57:28,842 --> 00:57:33,529
...but usually never get a chance
to use it. And then it just goes away.

834
00:57:33,514 --> 00:57:38,664
But you can. You've got this
opportunity, so do it. Why not?

835
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:43,105
I mean, this is who you are.
This is who you'll always be.

836
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:46,533
And you don't move aside for nobody
until you're ready to move.

837
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:49,480
And it doesn't matter
how this looks to other people.

838
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:51,930
All that matters
is how it looks to you.

839
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:55,593
Rocky.

840
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,817
Rocky, look at me.

841
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:03,427
How it looks to you.

842
00:58:04,282 --> 00:58:06,359
And if this is something
that you wanna do...

843
00:58:06,451 --> 00:58:10,651
...and if this is something that
you gotta do, then you do it.

844
00:58:11,892 --> 00:58:13,624
Fighters fight.

845
00:58:17,296 --> 00:58:19,835
You're not gonna punch me,
are you?

846
00:58:23,336 --> 00:58:27,121
Listen, I gotta go before I wear out
my welcome. I'll see you tomorrow.

847
00:58:28,442 --> 00:58:29,796
Thanks.

848
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,986
Fighters fight, right?

849
00:58:49,132 --> 00:58:53,262
It's rare when you get to promote
an event bigger than boxing. This is.

850
00:58:53,271 --> 00:58:57,200
Skill versus will, with part
of the proceeds going to charity.

851
00:58:57,209 --> 00:59:01,587
The brainchild of Mason Dixon,
to honor past heavyweight champions.

852
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:04,951
Warriors like Rocky Balboa.
Let's open it up for questions.

853
00:59:04,984 --> 00:59:06,229
Hey, champ!

854
00:59:06,352 --> 00:59:10,517
A few great fighters have fought in
their 50s, often with disastrous results.

855
00:59:10,524 --> 00:59:12,256
Why risk the danger
and embarrassment?

856
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:14,897
The smart money says
you have virtually no chance.

857
00:59:14,962 --> 00:59:19,199
A puncher always has a chance.
This fight will be competitive.

858
00:59:20,468 --> 00:59:22,544
Why are you doing this, Rocky?

859
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:26,981
<i>I don't know, I'd rather do
something I love badly than...</i>

860
00:59:26,976 --> 00:59:31,770
<i>Than to feel bad by not
doing something you love.</i>

861
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:35,125
Rocky, the press has labeled you
a Balboasaurus.

862
00:59:36,886 --> 00:59:38,618
How do you feel about that?

863
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:42,851
Let's say the following happens:
You win, we'll say you beat an old guy.

864
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,504
You lose, say a thumb in the eye,
you'll be the joke of the decade.

865
00:59:46,532 --> 00:59:50,080
You all know that will never happen.
This is only an exhibition.

866
00:59:50,102 --> 00:59:53,687
Don't go trying to make more out
of this than that computer tried.

867
00:59:55,407 --> 00:59:59,157
Isn't this sport in enough trouble
without these circus events?

868
00:59:59,311 --> 01:00:01,708
- Next question.
- On the surface, this looks like...

869
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:04,284
...a cheap bit of ring theater
between, no offense...

870
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,984
...a has-been and a man
whose own credible legacy...

871
01:00:07,054 --> 01:00:08,608
...and popularity is in doubt.

872
01:00:08,723 --> 01:00:10,419
- What's the upside?
- Doubt?

873
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,157
Upside? I mean...

874
01:00:13,227 --> 01:00:17,048
What do you mean, upside?
I mean, what do I have to do?

875
01:00:18,134 --> 01:00:20,496
You know, I'm 33-0
with 30 knockouts.

876
01:00:20,669 --> 01:00:23,730
I'm doing you people a favor.
I'm having this exhibition for you.

877
01:00:23,773 --> 01:00:26,894
You gonna get up here and make
a mockery out of me? I'm the champ.

878
01:00:27,444 --> 01:00:29,697
I mean, I get pissed,
this guy get hurt.

879
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:32,279
See you at the fight.

880
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,682
The guy's a joke.
He's gonna get crushed.

881
01:00:48,334 --> 01:00:50,137
- Look who's here.
- How you doing?

882
01:00:50,236 --> 01:00:52,598
- Have you seen my father?
- He's in the back.

883
01:00:52,672 --> 01:00:55,627
This place has never served
this many meals. It's unbelievable.

884
01:00:55,675 --> 01:00:59,947
You're doing good? Hope you're
enjoying everything, all right?

885
01:01:02,017 --> 01:01:03,606
Excuse me.

886
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:08,934
How you doing? Glad you come by.

887
01:01:09,357 --> 01:01:10,532
Can I talk with you?

888
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:13,390
- Sure.
- Can we do it outside?

889
01:01:18,135 --> 01:01:21,090
- So you're going through with this?
- I start training tomorrow.

890
01:01:21,137 --> 01:01:24,507
Hey, Rock.
I made some connections.

891
01:01:24,542 --> 01:01:27,010
I can make some money
on this, endorsements.

892
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:29,324
Absolutely. Do that.

893
01:01:29,681 --> 01:01:32,220
- Thank you, Rock. Okay.
- Sure.

894
01:01:32,818 --> 01:01:36,365
- So you nervous about the fight?
- Scared to death.

895
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:39,236
- You don't look scared.
- Well, I ain't supposed to.

896
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:41,794
Then you don't have to do it.

897
01:01:41,862 --> 01:01:44,258
Yeah, well, I think I do.

898
01:01:47,267 --> 01:01:50,567
You know, living with you,
it hasn't been easy.

899
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:53,347
People see me
but they think of you.

900
01:01:53,406 --> 01:01:56,361
Now with all this going on,
it's gonna be worse than ever.

901
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:58,428
- It don't have to be.
- Sure it does!

902
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:01,361
- Why? You've got a lot going on, kid.
- What, my last name?

903
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:03,433
That's the reason I got a decent job.

904
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,808
That's why people deal with me
in the first place.

905
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,622
Now I start to get a little ahead...

906
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:11,831
...I start to get a little something
for myself, and this happens.

907
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:15,235
Now, I'm asking you as a favor
not to go through with this.

908
01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:18,566
This is gonna end up bad for you,
and it's gonna end up bad for me.

909
01:02:18,603 --> 01:02:21,450
- You think I'm hurting you?
- Yeah. In a way, you are.

910
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:23,618
That's the last thing
I ever wanted to do.

911
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:27,292
I know that's not what you wanna do,
but that's just the way that it is.

912
01:02:27,312 --> 01:02:30,539
Don't you care what people think?
Doesn't it bother you that people...

913
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:33,775
...are making you out to be a joke
and that I'll be included in that?

914
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:36,978
Do you think that's right? Do you?

915
01:02:42,862 --> 01:02:48,012
You ain't gonna believe this,
but you used to fit right here.

916
01:02:47,968 --> 01:02:50,295
I'd hold you up
and say to your mother:

917
01:02:50,372 --> 01:02:53,042
"This kid is gonna be
the best kid in the world.

918
01:02:53,108 --> 01:02:56,478
This kid is gonna be somebody
better than anybody ever knew."

919
01:02:56,513 --> 01:02:59,467
And you grew up
good and wonderful.

920
01:02:59,515 --> 01:03:02,778
It was great just watching,
every day was like a privilege.

921
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,154
Then the time come for you to be
your own man and take on the world...

922
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:10,914
...and you did. But somewhere
along the line, you changed.

923
01:03:10,895 --> 01:03:12,211
You stopped being you.

924
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:15,772
You let people stick a finger in
your face and tell you you're no good.

925
01:03:15,801 --> 01:03:19,622
And when things got hard, you started
looking for something to blame...

926
01:03:19,638 --> 01:03:21,822
...like a big shadow.

927
01:03:23,209 --> 01:03:25,571
Let me tell you something
you already know.

928
01:03:25,646 --> 01:03:28,079
The world ain't all
sunshine and rainbows.

929
01:03:28,147 --> 01:03:32,147
It's a very mean and nasty place,
and I don't care how tough you are...

930
01:03:32,152 --> 01:03:35,902
...it will beat you to your knees
and keep you there if you let it.

931
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:40,556
You, me or nobody
is gonna hit as hard as life.

932
01:03:40,563 --> 01:03:44,872
But it ain't about how hard you hit.
It's about how hard you can get hit...

933
01:03:44,865 --> 01:03:46,325
...and keep moving forward.

934
01:03:46,434 --> 01:03:49,768
How much you can take
and keep moving forward.

935
01:03:49,805 --> 01:03:52,308
That's how winning is done!

936
01:03:52,676 --> 01:03:55,523
If you know what you're worth,
go and get what you're worth.

937
01:03:55,579 --> 01:03:58,985
But you gotta be willing to take
the hits, and not pointing fingers...

938
01:03:59,017 --> 01:04:03,289
...saying you ain't where you wanna be
because of him or her or anybody!

939
01:04:03,288 --> 01:04:07,703
Cowards do that, and that ain't you!
You're better than that!

940
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,743
I'm always gonna love you
no matter what.

941
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,716
No matter what happens.

942
01:04:20,007 --> 01:04:22,925
You're my son and you're my blood.

943
01:04:22,977 --> 01:04:25,859
You're the best thing in my life.

944
01:04:26,981 --> 01:04:31,015
But until you start believing in
yourself, you ain't gonna have a life.

945
01:04:35,691 --> 01:04:38,289
Don't forget to visit your mother.

946
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:30,824
- Yeah, those are beautiful.
- Yeah.

947
01:05:32,654 --> 01:05:35,881
- You get off early from work?
- No.

948
01:05:36,192 --> 01:05:37,746
I left.

949
01:05:38,329 --> 01:05:39,918
I quit.

950
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:41,984
Quit, why?

951
01:05:43,335 --> 01:05:45,802
I wasn't very...

952
01:05:46,337 --> 01:05:49,600
I don't know, I just...
I didn't fit in there.

953
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:53,004
I understand.

954
01:05:57,616 --> 01:06:01,022
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Right now?

955
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:05,094
Right now I'd rather be with you.

956
01:06:07,327 --> 01:06:09,202
Is that all right?

957
01:06:10,464 --> 01:06:12,339
Yeah.

958
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,555
It's been a long time
since I seen a fight.

959
01:06:27,284 --> 01:06:27,353
You know all there is
to know about fighting...

960
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:29,603
You know all there is
to know about fighting...

961
01:06:29,687 --> 01:06:32,986
...so there's no sense us going down
that same old road again.

962
01:06:33,023 --> 01:06:37,331
To beat this guy, you need speed.
You don't have it.

963
01:06:38,663 --> 01:06:42,769
And your knees can't take the
pounding, so hard running is out.

964
01:06:42,768 --> 01:06:46,660
And you got arthritis in your neck.
And you've got calcium deposits...

965
01:06:46,672 --> 01:06:50,113
...on most of your joints,
so sparring is out.

966
01:06:50,911 --> 01:06:52,442
I had that problem.

967
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,703
So what we'll be calling on is good
old-fashioned blunt-force trauma.

968
01:06:58,653 --> 01:07:03,518
Horsepower. Heavy-duty,
cast-iron, pile-driving punches...

969
01:07:03,492 --> 01:07:06,648
...that will have to hurt so much
they'll rattle his ancestors.

970
01:07:07,095 --> 01:07:08,899
Every time you hit him with a shot...

971
01:07:08,997 --> 01:07:12,094
...it's gotta feel like he tried kissing
the express train.

972
01:07:13,302 --> 01:07:17,408
Yeah! Let's start building
some hurting bombs.

973
01:07:49,544 --> 01:07:52,498
- Yeah, you'll get it.
- You can do it, Rocko!

974
01:08:28,254 --> 01:08:29,879
Getting stronger!

975
01:08:32,225 --> 01:08:34,028
- Up! Up! Up!
- Come on!

976
01:08:35,896 --> 01:08:37,212
Go!

977
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:45,225
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

978
01:08:47,843 --> 01:08:49,303
Come on, Rocko!

979
01:08:56,652 --> 01:08:59,049
Come on. Come on.
Let's hit them. Hit them.

980
01:09:04,494 --> 01:09:05,847
You can do it, Rock.

981
01:09:08,935 --> 01:09:10,180
Getting stronger!

982
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:24,169
- Up, up, up!
- Go! Go!

983
01:09:25,218 --> 01:09:26,748
All right!

984
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:28,537
Yeah! Yeah!

985
01:09:48,211 --> 01:09:49,908
Yeah!

986
01:09:59,624 --> 01:10:03,861
Rocky Balboa, 217!

987
01:10:04,429 --> 01:10:10,825
The undisputed heavyweight
champion, Mason Dixon, 221!

988
01:10:13,572 --> 01:10:16,693
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it, champ. Thanks a lot.

989
01:10:22,683 --> 01:10:27,549
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

990
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:35,077
- Know how much money is in this?
- A lot of it.

991
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:37,632
Imagine trying to clean this place.

992
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,160
- No, seriously.
- Balboa!

993
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:45,656
You guys, I'll catch up
with you all later, okay?

994
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:47,998
Robert, why don't
you hang with me?

995
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:52,141
- How you doing, champ?
- I'm good.

996
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:56,258
No reason for neither one of us
to get hurt in this fight.

997
01:10:56,322 --> 01:10:59,442
I'll do my best to carry you,
make sure you save face.

998
01:10:59,492 --> 01:11:01,366
There'd be no embarrassment.

999
01:11:01,459 --> 01:11:05,944
But I promise you, you try to press me,
you hit me, you hurt me...

1000
01:11:05,966 --> 01:11:09,645
...you hit me low, cheap-shot me,
I'll get you out of there.

1001
01:11:10,937 --> 01:11:15,280
You know, a lot of people come
to Vegas to lose. I didn't.

1002
01:11:15,308 --> 01:11:16,661
It's already over.

1003
01:11:16,778 --> 01:11:18,760
Ain't nothing over till it's over.

1004
01:11:18,846 --> 01:11:20,580
What's that from, the '80s?

1005
01:11:20,682 --> 01:11:23,150
That's probably the '70s.

1006
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:27,510
Just remember what I said.

1007
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:31,071
Hey, yo, champ.

1008
01:11:31,227 --> 01:11:32,925
Yo, ain't you a little scared?

1009
01:11:33,829 --> 01:11:35,739
I don't get scared.

1010
01:11:38,735 --> 01:11:41,274
I think you try a little harder
when you're scared.

1011
01:11:41,773 --> 01:11:45,107
This is what has worked for me.

1012
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:48,178
- I ain't scared.
- Oh, yeah. You ain't scared of me?

1013
01:11:48,246 --> 01:11:50,749
Come on, let's see what you got.
Come on.

1014
01:11:50,816 --> 01:11:52,311
Hey, don't hit me, I'm brittle.

1015
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:09,704
- Hey.
- Hi.

1016
01:12:09,805 --> 01:12:11,537
- How you doing?
- I was just thinking.

1017
01:12:11,639 --> 01:12:14,035
- Did you wanna come in?
- No, no, no, it's okay.

1018
01:12:14,108 --> 01:12:16,363
I just wanted to...

1019
01:12:16,444 --> 01:12:19,363
...I don' t know, come by and wish you
good luck for tomorrow.

1020
01:12:19,415 --> 01:12:21,324
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1021
01:12:21,418 --> 01:12:23,471
I brought you something.

1022
01:12:23,553 --> 01:12:25,986
I hope you don't mind,
I took it from the restaurant.

1023
01:12:26,055 --> 01:12:27,929
- No.
- Thanks.

1024
01:12:28,025 --> 01:12:29,863
Adrian.

1025
01:12:29,959 --> 01:12:32,843
Yeah. Thought she would
keep you safe.

1026
01:12:32,897 --> 01:12:35,436
Yeah. Yeah, she always
brought me luck.

1027
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:37,304
Yeah.

1028
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:43,217
I wanted to say thanks for everything
you've done for me and my kid.

1029
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:45,793
You've been great and...

1030
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:52,098
You know, tomorrow...

1031
01:12:53,486 --> 01:12:57,651
...you're gonna prove that the last thing
to age on somebody is their heart.

1032
01:12:59,528 --> 01:13:01,817
- I'll try.
- You go show them.

1033
01:13:01,896 --> 01:13:03,629
Thank you.

1034
01:13:24,789 --> 01:13:26,663
<i>The heavyweight championship
has been...</i>

1035
01:13:26,757 --> 01:13:30,472
<i>... one of sports' most coveted titles
for 120 years.</i>

1036
01:13:30,662 --> 01:13:33,166
<i>Two-time heavyweight champion
Rocky Balboa...</i>

1037
01:13:33,231 --> 01:13:36,458
<i>... the Philadelphia slugger,
renowned for his cast-iron jaw...</i>

1038
01:13:36,503 --> 01:13:39,386
<i>... ferocious body attack
and will of steel...</i>

1039
01:13:39,773 --> 01:13:42,764
<i>... all of which have carried
the smaller fighter to victories...</i>

1040
01:13:42,809 --> 01:13:46,357
<i>... over the years against
physically superior opponents.</i>

1041
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,085
<i>And Mason Dixon, the current
heavyweight title holder...</i>

1042
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:52,662
<i>... with all the speed, determination
and confidence any fighter could want.</i>

1043
01:13:52,687 --> 01:13:56,817
<i>But many still question whether
he has the heart of a true champion...</i>

1044
01:13:56,825 --> 01:14:00,789
<i>... never having been pushed to go
the distance. Tonight, we find out.</i>

1045
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:04,803
<i>Here at the Mandalay Bay
Event Center in Las Vegas...</i>

1046
01:14:04,867 --> 01:14:06,776
<i>... for the much-anticipated
showdown...</i>

1047
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:08,887
<i>... between Mason
"The Line" Dixon...</i>

1048
01:14:08,972 --> 01:14:11,998
<i>... and Rocky
"The Italian Stallion" Balboa.</i>

1049
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:15,437
Hello, I'm Jim Lampley with
Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman...

1050
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:18,814
...live from the Mandalay Bay Hotel
in Las Vegas, where we anticipate...

1051
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:22,185
...one of the most outrageous and
compelling events in boxing history.

1052
01:14:22,220 --> 01:14:26,112
The unappreciated heavyweight
champion, Mason "The Line" Dixon...

1053
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:27,963
<i>... putting his reputation
on the line...</i>

1054
01:14:29,228 --> 01:14:31,103
<i>... against legendary ex-champion,
Rocky Balboa.</i>

1055
01:14:32,365 --> 01:14:35,557
<i>Even though most see this as more
of a glorified sparring session...</i>

1056
01:14:35,602 --> 01:14:37,655
...the energy in the room is electric.

1057
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:39,922
Larry, why is this billed
as an exhibition?

1058
01:14:40,007 --> 01:14:44,350
Wild guess: So they wouldn't
have to call it an execution.

1059
01:14:44,978 --> 01:14:50,402
Zacariah 4:6 says,
"It is not by strength, not by might...

1060
01:14:50,353 --> 01:14:54,281
...but by his spirit
we have already claimed the victory...

1061
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:57,101
...in our Lord Jesus Christ."

1062
01:14:57,627 --> 01:14:59,395
Good luck, Rocky.

1063
01:14:59,497 --> 01:15:01,858
Thanks, Spider. Appreciate it.

1064
01:15:12,877 --> 01:15:16,283
Nobody's expecting much, I think,
from the way-past-his-prime...

1065
01:15:16,314 --> 01:15:18,498
...former champ, Rocky Balboa.

1066
01:15:18,885 --> 01:15:22,291
Rock, I gotta talk to you.

1067
01:15:22,922 --> 01:15:29,010
Look, I know you got a lot of stuff
you gotta get out of your system.

1068
01:15:29,662 --> 01:15:34,422
Tonight you do it. Right?
Get rid of the damn beast...

1069
01:15:34,401 --> 01:15:39,444
...let it be done, once and for all.
Please, I love you.

1070
01:15:40,141 --> 01:15:43,926
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1071
01:15:48,584 --> 01:15:53,177
There go the lights. The buzz is
building toward a roaring crescendo.

1072
01:16:08,906 --> 01:16:11,197
Where did that come from?

1073
01:16:11,277 --> 01:16:14,398
I told you. I love Sinatra.

1074
01:16:14,948 --> 01:16:17,060
He's very good, Sinatra.

1075
01:16:17,149 --> 01:16:20,306
- Let's go.
- Very good.

1076
01:16:22,424 --> 01:16:27,111
And here comes Rocky Balboa,
veteran of the wars...

1077
01:16:27,129 --> 01:16:29,905
...here for one more last hurrah.

1078
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:33,026
Or the Last Supper, perhaps,
with him as the main course.

1079
01:16:33,068 --> 01:16:35,810
What's that music?
You can't be serious.

1080
01:16:35,872 --> 01:16:38,719
"High Hopes"?
Talk about wishful thinking.

1081
01:16:38,809 --> 01:16:42,416
Well, maybe no hopes is more
realistic. Anyway, the crowd likes it.

1082
01:16:43,113 --> 01:16:46,448
Look at the Italian Stallion.
Cool and relaxed.

1083
01:16:46,483 --> 01:16:50,375
Rocky's an off-the-board underdog,
and they don't care at all.

1084
01:16:50,388 --> 01:16:54,316
This is about his pride and dignity
and his punch, guys.

1085
01:16:54,392 --> 01:16:57,026
The last thing to go
is a guy's punch.

1086
01:16:57,096 --> 01:17:00,703
Rocky always has
that puncher's chance.

1087
01:17:04,905 --> 01:17:09,178
Rocky Balboa is still, as you can hear,
the people's champion.

1088
01:17:09,176 --> 01:17:11,714
Prediction, guys:
For at least two rounds...

1089
01:17:11,779 --> 01:17:13,582
...Dixon's gonna have
his hands full.

1090
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,880
Two whole rounds? We have
a cockeyed optimist in the house.

1091
01:17:18,686 --> 01:17:20,596
- How you doing?
- The crowd wants to see...

1092
01:17:20,688 --> 01:17:22,420
...something real, or at least...

1093
01:17:22,523 --> 01:17:24,636
Rocky Balboa just asked me
how I'm doing.

1094
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:29,591
I grew up watching this guy. I never
thought I'd be calling one of his fights.

1095
01:17:29,898 --> 01:17:32,710
This is unbelievable.
I'm a fan, I can't help it.

1096
01:17:32,769 --> 01:17:35,511
Now here comes Mason Dixon.

1097
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,217
Mason Dixon establishing
his presence in the ring.

1098
01:18:12,281 --> 01:18:16,210
And suddenly now a conversation
breaking out at ringside.

1099
01:18:16,218 --> 01:18:19,065
Mike Tyson calling out
Mason "The Line" Dixon.

1100
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:21,755
You can't call no shots here.
I'm the champ.

1101
01:18:21,826 --> 01:18:24,293
You not doing nothing.
This is charity work.

1102
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,552
You got that midget
with you right there.

1103
01:18:32,137 --> 01:18:35,779
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Mandalay Bay...

1104
01:18:37,243 --> 01:18:39,876
...resort and casino of Las Vegas.

1105
01:18:39,945 --> 01:18:43,552
And a special main event
of the evening...

1106
01:18:43,582 --> 01:18:47,024
...10 rounds of
heavyweight excitement...

1107
01:18:47,053 --> 01:18:49,592
...sanctioned by the Nevada
State Athletic Commission.

1108
01:18:49,657 --> 01:18:53,692
And when the bell rings, the referee
in charge of the action, Joe Cortez.

1109
01:18:55,296 --> 01:18:58,559
And now, for the thousands
in attendance...

1110
01:18:58,598 --> 01:19:04,580
...and the millions watching around
the world, ladies and gentlemen...

1111
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:10,310
...let's get ready to rumble!

1112
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:15,780
Introducing first,
fighting out of the blue corner...

1113
01:19:15,818 --> 01:19:20,720
...wearing black with gold,
official weight, 217 pounds.

1114
01:19:20,691 --> 01:19:25,520
His professional record, 57 victories
including 54 knockouts...

1115
01:19:25,495 --> 01:19:28,652
...with 23 defeats and one draw.

1116
01:19:28,701 --> 01:19:32,000
He is the fighting pride
of Philadelphia...

1117
01:19:32,138 --> 01:19:36,695
...the two-time heavyweight
champion of the world...

1118
01:19:36,676 --> 01:19:38,859
..."The Italian Stallion"...

1119
01:19:38,944 --> 01:19:43,739
...Rocky...

1120
01:19:43,718 --> 01:19:46,185
...Balboa!

1121
01:19:49,123 --> 01:19:50,783
Hope he gets his head busted.

1122
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,777
Shut up.

1123
01:19:57,466 --> 01:20:00,385
Across the ring,
fighting out of the red corner...

1124
01:20:00,436 --> 01:20:04,400
...wearing white with blue,
official weight, 221 pounds.

1125
01:20:04,474 --> 01:20:09,683
He has a perfect professional record,
consisting of 33 bouts...

1126
01:20:09,646 --> 01:20:13,052
...33 victories,
including 30 knockouts.

1127
01:20:13,083 --> 01:20:15,136
Originally from Tampa, Florida...

1128
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:18,376
...but now fighting out
of Las Vegas, Nevada...

1129
01:20:18,423 --> 01:20:22,944
...the reigning undisputed,
undefeated...

1130
01:20:22,928 --> 01:20:26,025
...heavyweight champion
of the world...

1131
01:20:26,065 --> 01:20:29,708
...Mason "The Line"...

1132
01:20:29,736 --> 01:20:33,865
...Dixon!

1133
01:20:37,845 --> 01:20:39,577
All right, gentlemen.

1134
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,192
All right, Mason, Rocky. We went
over the rules in the dressing room.

1135
01:20:43,217 --> 01:20:47,418
I expect a good, clean fight. Watch
the kidney punches, rabbit punches...

1136
01:20:47,423 --> 01:20:50,758
...low blows, be careful with those.
Give me good sportsmanlike conduct.

1137
01:20:50,794 --> 01:20:54,650
Remember, gentlemen, I'm fair
but I'm firm. Touch them up!

1138
01:20:54,663 --> 01:20:57,334
- Enjoy the ride.
- The champ is not in the best shape...

1139
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,840
...we've seen him in. Maybe he plans
to phone this in and go home early.

1140
01:21:00,872 --> 01:21:03,409
- That wouldn't be a surprise.
- Glad you could make it.

1141
01:21:03,474 --> 01:21:06,215
One thing about Rocky
we know for sure:

1142
01:21:06,277 --> 01:21:08,604
This guy's showing up in shape.

1143
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,634
- The old man's crazy.
- He's gotta be crazy. He's in here.

1144
01:21:11,684 --> 01:21:13,701
- Okay.
- Take it easy. This is an exhibition.

1145
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,316
All right? Do it to him.

1146
01:21:15,421 --> 01:21:18,756
You got three rounds to set a pace.
Every time you hit him, make a dent.

1147
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,844
- Got it.
- The moments before...

1148
01:21:20,926 --> 01:21:24,570
...a Rocky Balboa fight?
I can't believe it's here!

1149
01:21:25,566 --> 01:21:26,847
Round one begins.

1150
01:21:26,967 --> 01:21:30,824
If old George Foreman shocked
the world with one punch...

1151
01:21:30,839 --> 01:21:33,058
...why can't old Rocky Balboa?

1152
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:35,573
And as much excitement
as there is in the arena...

1153
01:21:35,643 --> 01:21:38,111
...there's a sense of foreboding
as well.

1154
01:21:42,351 --> 01:21:46,171
And now, Mason "The Line" Dixon
goes to work with his jab as though...

1155
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:50,223
...he's fighting against the number one
challenger in the heavyweight division.

1156
01:21:50,494 --> 01:21:52,476
See, this is to be expected early on.

1157
01:21:52,562 --> 01:21:55,373
You knew the champ would
control the distance with his jab...

1158
01:21:55,433 --> 01:21:57,546
...his height, his range.

1159
01:21:58,836 --> 01:22:02,063
Balboa looking to get in a shot,
misses wildly.

1160
01:22:02,106 --> 01:22:04,017
Did you like that?

1161
01:22:04,409 --> 01:22:07,672
It looks like a speed bag
against a punching bag.

1162
01:22:07,747 --> 01:22:09,408
Rocky's understandably frustrated...

1163
01:22:09,515 --> 01:22:11,948
...but he came out of retirement
to get into a fight.

1164
01:22:12,019 --> 01:22:14,689
Guys named Rocky
don't like to be toyed with.

1165
01:22:14,753 --> 01:22:16,521
One punch could still turn it around.

1166
01:22:16,656 --> 01:22:19,883
Apparently he forgot
his arthritis meds this morning.

1167
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,591
Rocky misses.

1168
01:22:21,897 --> 01:22:25,788
There's a meat-seeking missile
on the point of the chin by the champ.

1169
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,648
<i>- More pinpoint jabs by Dixon.
- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1170
01:22:28,703 --> 01:22:32,179
And there's a hard right hand
and a left and a right by Balboa!

1171
01:22:32,207 --> 01:22:35,303
He drives Dixon into the ropes
with a series of shots!

1172
01:22:35,344 --> 01:22:37,883
And the crowd goes berserk!

1173
01:22:42,618 --> 01:22:47,069
Dixon punishing Balboa for
the temerity of landing those shots.

1174
01:22:50,396 --> 01:22:55,190
It's toe to toe in the corner.
Balboa and Dixon letting it all go.

1175
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:04,731
Balboa landing potent combinations
to the head of the champion.

1176
01:23:04,944 --> 01:23:06,226
A wake-up call for Dixon.

1177
01:23:06,346 --> 01:23:08,042
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1178
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:11,483
- The man's got bricks in his gloves.
- Where's the stuff in the basement?

1179
01:23:11,518 --> 01:23:13,808
- It's still there.
- He came to battle, okay?

1180
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:15,418
- Trying to knock me out.
- Listen.

1181
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:18,062
If there's a bone he can break,
he's gonna do it.

1182
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:20,523
- Give the man respect.
- What about my respect?

1183
01:23:20,597 --> 01:23:23,552
CompuBox numbers
tell the grisly story here.

1184
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,792
Balboa landed nine of 13
punches in that round.

1185
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:32,222
Dixon landed an incredible
59 out of 69.

1186
01:23:32,175 --> 01:23:35,782
- Why don't you listen to me?
- Rocky's been here a million times.

1187
01:23:35,813 --> 01:23:39,148
Coming out to start a round after
he took a beating in the previous one.

1188
01:23:39,184 --> 01:23:42,482
- Remember what I said, okay?
- I warned him. I warned him.

1189
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:48,570
He's tired. His legs are going fast,
or already gone.

1190
01:23:48,526 --> 01:23:53,285
And what's truly extraordinary
is that Rocky can still take it.

1191
01:23:53,265 --> 01:23:58,415
The boxing commission, which
was criticized for licensing him...

1192
01:23:58,372 --> 01:24:02,787
...would be massacred
if something happened to Rocky.

1193
01:24:05,914 --> 01:24:08,690
And a monstrous straight left hand!
Down goes Rocky!

1194
01:24:08,783 --> 01:24:11,180
And that could conceivably
be the end of the fight!

1195
01:24:11,252 --> 01:24:15,252
That could be the exhibition
right there. But no. Balboa up.

1196
01:24:15,258 --> 01:24:19,743
Referee Joe Cortez asks if he wants
to continue, and Rocky says yes.

1197
01:24:19,729 --> 01:24:22,720
Even Rocky Balboa could be
too brave for his own good.

1198
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:26,517
Dixon comes right back to try to
finish it. Balboa almost went down!

1199
01:24:26,537 --> 01:24:28,614
Rocky actually shoves Dixon back.

1200
01:24:28,705 --> 01:24:31,339
As Dixon lands these brutal shots.

1201
01:24:31,409 --> 01:24:34,080
- Cover up! Cover up!
- Open shots at close range.

1202
01:24:34,146 --> 01:24:36,780
Right and left hands,
and down goes Balboa!

1203
01:24:36,848 --> 01:24:40,360
Perhaps for the last time
in his fighting career!

1204
01:24:40,385 --> 01:24:42,889
- That should do it.
- Three! Four!

1205
01:24:42,954 --> 01:24:45,387
Five! Six!

1206
01:24:45,459 --> 01:24:47,156
Get up! Get up!
- Seven!

1207
01:24:47,261 --> 01:24:49,136
Eight! Nine!

1208
01:24:50,495 --> 01:24:53,830
- How do you feel, man? You okay?
- Now Rocky is furious with himself.

1209
01:24:53,867 --> 01:24:56,572
He convinces Cortez
he wants to keep fighting.

1210
01:24:56,637 --> 01:24:58,583
Dixon's pointing at the ref to end it.

1211
01:24:58,673 --> 01:25:00,857
Rocky waving his arms
and saying he's fine.

1212
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:03,195
- He wants to go on!
- Let it go! Let it go!

1213
01:25:04,046 --> 01:25:07,237
And Balboa comes back!
With a left and a right...

1214
01:25:07,282 --> 01:25:11,352
...and bulls Dixon into the ropes
for the second round in a row!

1215
01:25:12,388 --> 01:25:15,058
Back comes Dixon
with brutal left-hand shots.

1216
01:25:15,124 --> 01:25:17,414
- Dixon hurt his hand there!
- Go after him!

1217
01:25:17,494 --> 01:25:19,226
This is Rocky's best chance!

1218
01:25:19,329 --> 01:25:21,656
The champ obviously hurt
his hand on Rocky's hip!

1219
01:25:21,732 --> 01:25:25,731
And Balboa immediately going to
work to the body! Huge right hook!

1220
01:25:25,737 --> 01:25:29,451
Balboa ripping away at Dixon's body!
These are big punches.

1221
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:33,433
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1222
01:25:34,681 --> 01:25:35,784
Yes!

1223
01:25:38,184 --> 01:25:42,836
Rocky Balboa has knocked the
reigning heavyweight champion down!

1224
01:25:42,822 --> 01:25:44,804
- You hurt him!
- Mason "The Line" Dixon...

1225
01:25:44,892 --> 01:25:47,039
...has never taken
this kind of punishment...

1226
01:25:47,127 --> 01:25:49,382
...in his entire professional career!

1227
01:25:49,464 --> 01:25:53,629
Maybe he's clearing his head, but
the body shots really caved in his ribs.

1228
01:25:53,635 --> 01:25:56,411
Balboa is thinking knockout himself!

1229
01:25:56,472 --> 01:26:00,151
Another counterhook by Balboa,
followed by two more!

1230
01:26:00,176 --> 01:26:02,774
Dixon fires back his own hooks!
Now Rocky's stunned.

1231
01:26:02,846 --> 01:26:05,479
It's an all-out war along the ropes...

1232
01:26:05,548 --> 01:26:10,793
...as round two comes to a close
amid a giant tumult in the ring!

1233
01:26:11,287 --> 01:26:12,948
Incredible.

1234
01:26:13,057 --> 01:26:14,789
All right!

1235
01:26:14,892 --> 01:26:16,767
Welcome to Rockyland.

1236
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,339
- How's the hand?
- My hand's broken.

1237
01:26:25,337 --> 01:26:27,449
We lose, it's your ass! Your ass!

1238
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:29,938
It will numb up on you
in a few rounds.

1239
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:33,760
Once that hand numbs up,
Dixon will be able to throw it hard.

1240
01:26:33,781 --> 01:26:36,284
Until then, here is Rocky's chance.

1241
01:26:36,349 --> 01:26:39,197
- No reverse!
- Take the pain, champ.

1242
01:26:39,253 --> 01:26:42,171
Stay on him! Everybody thought
this was a joke, including me!

1243
01:26:42,223 --> 01:26:44,965
Now nobody's laughing!
Stay on him! You go get him!

1244
01:26:45,627 --> 01:26:47,609
Go out strong!

1245
01:26:59,343 --> 01:27:00,375
Keep him off you!

1246
01:27:04,215 --> 01:27:05,247
That's it! That's it!

1247
01:27:19,665 --> 01:27:21,813
You won that round.
Break him down.

1248
01:27:27,407 --> 01:27:29,484
Bomb him! Bomb him!

1249
01:27:35,117 --> 01:27:36,363
Yeah!

1250
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,652
Just keep throwing them bombs!

1251
01:27:54,337 --> 01:27:55,548
Come on.

1252
01:28:03,047 --> 01:28:05,196
You can do this.

1253
01:28:05,984 --> 01:28:08,867
Rocko. Rocko.

1254
01:28:17,363 --> 01:28:19,831
Yeah, come on, go!

1255
01:29:16,798 --> 01:29:18,742
Go through him! Run over him!

1256
01:29:34,118 --> 01:29:35,399
Unload on him!

1257
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:38,252
Get down, Mason!

1258
01:29:50,036 --> 01:29:52,112
They're leaving nothing
on the table, guys.

1259
01:29:52,238 --> 01:29:56,927
The fans are still standing. They may
not be able to sit down for a week.

1260
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:59,793
- You're doing great!
- I'm doing better than I thought.

1261
01:29:59,846 --> 01:30:03,810
- You sure he's okay?
- I've had worse.

1262
01:30:03,818 --> 01:30:07,710
Toe to toe, one round to go. Who
would've believed this was possible?

1263
01:30:07,723 --> 01:30:10,190
- Can you see out of that eye?
- Let me talk to him.

1264
01:30:10,491 --> 01:30:12,603
Don't take any more chances
than you have to.

1265
01:30:12,695 --> 01:30:15,792
There's nothing more to prove, Pop.
There's nothing more to prove.

1266
01:30:15,831 --> 01:30:18,050
I gotta go out the way I gotta go out.

1267
01:30:18,134 --> 01:30:19,759
You can do it, Rocko!

1268
01:30:19,902 --> 01:30:22,300
- One more round, we go home.
- Okay, then do it.

1269
01:30:22,372 --> 01:30:26,050
There's an old saying that
every great champion has...

1270
01:30:26,075 --> 01:30:31,606
...one great fight left in him,
and Rocky is proving it so far.

1271
01:30:31,549 --> 01:30:34,883
- Come on. Touch them up.
- Rocko! The last round of your life!

1272
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,653
- Come on, guys.
- The last round!

1273
01:30:36,755 --> 01:30:39,223
Come on. Touch them up, let's go.
Touch them up.

1274
01:30:39,791 --> 01:30:42,818
- You are one crazy old man.
- You'll get there.

1275
01:30:43,161 --> 01:30:44,372
Let's go.

1276
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:48,001
Tenth round of a scheduled 10.
Who would ever have dreamed...

1277
01:30:48,035 --> 01:30:53,043
...that Rocky Balboa would still be
in this quote, "exhibition," against...

1278
01:30:53,006 --> 01:30:55,889
...the heavyweight champion?
- You can do it! Come on!

1279
01:30:55,943 --> 01:31:00,464
This fight is as though Dixon
got on-the-job training in courage.

1280
01:31:01,383 --> 01:31:04,265
- Cover up! Cover up!
- They're both in a pain-free zone!

1281
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:07,690
These guys are fighting
in another dimension right now!

1282
01:31:07,723 --> 01:31:11,959
Beyond belief! Balboa just walking
straight into Dixon's punches.

1283
01:31:11,961 --> 01:31:14,668
Target practice for Dixon.

1284
01:31:18,002 --> 01:31:20,576
They're exchanging right hooks!
Balboa's drilled!

1285
01:31:20,638 --> 01:31:24,008
Here comes Dixon! He's exhausted
from just punching the man!

1286
01:31:25,744 --> 01:31:27,132
Knock this bum out, Mase!

1287
01:31:39,626 --> 01:31:43,827
<i>What is it you said to the kid?
It ain't about how hard you hit.</i>

1288
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:48,031
<i>It's about how hard you can get hit
and keep moving forward.</i>

1289
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:52,025
<i>How much you can take
and keep moving forward.</i>

1290
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:53,916
<i>- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
- Get up.</i>

1291
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:56,086
<i>- Let's go! Get up!
- Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1292
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:59,024
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1293
01:31:59,149 --> 01:32:01,131
<i>Get up.</i>

1294
01:32:22,108 --> 01:32:25,857
Another monster body shot. Rocky's
ancestors must have felt that one.

1295
01:32:25,878 --> 01:32:28,026
Come on, Rocky!
Start moving those hands!

1296
01:32:28,181 --> 01:32:29,950
Less than two minutes to go.

1297
01:32:30,051 --> 01:32:32,519
The crowd is astonished
that Balboa got up.

1298
01:32:32,586 --> 01:32:35,185
- Come on!
- Turn it over! All the way through!

1299
01:32:35,524 --> 01:32:37,292
And retaliates with fury!

1300
01:32:40,761 --> 01:32:42,006
Chop him down!

1301
01:32:45,634 --> 01:32:47,367
Come on, Rocky! Come on!

1302
01:32:49,739 --> 01:32:51,364
Take him out now!

1303
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:54,591
They're trading shots again!

1304
01:32:54,677 --> 01:32:58,427
Balboa is trying to hit
anything and anywhere!

1305
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:02,006
Win it! Win it!

1306
01:33:11,097 --> 01:33:11,722
Yes!

1307
01:33:11,696 --> 01:33:12,633
Yes!

1308
01:33:21,375 --> 01:33:24,330
You're a great champion.
You got heart.

1309
01:33:24,379 --> 01:33:26,218
Thanks for the opportunity.
Good man.

1310
01:33:29,183 --> 01:33:32,410
That was unbelievable. That was
the greatest thing I've ever seen.

1311
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:37,268
You did it. That's the kind
of fighting you're talking about.

1312
01:33:38,726 --> 01:33:40,779
Hey, Paulie.

1313
01:33:40,896 --> 01:33:43,850
That beast is gone now.
The beast is out.

1314
01:33:43,899 --> 01:33:47,863
One of the most overused words
in sports, guys, is "incredible."

1315
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:52,356
I hate to say it. This is incredible.

1316
01:33:53,544 --> 01:33:55,276
Let's go!

1317
01:33:57,949 --> 01:34:01,770
Ladies and gentlemen,
before we go to the scorecards...

1318
01:34:01,786 --> 01:34:08,147
...a round of applause for these
two heavyweight warriors!

1319
01:34:12,531 --> 01:34:16,696
We have a split decision.

1320
01:34:19,174 --> 01:34:24,253
Adelaide Byrd scores it 95-94...

1321
01:34:24,212 --> 01:34:26,086
...Dixon.

1322
01:34:27,314 --> 01:34:31,907
Chuck Giampa has it 95-94...

1323
01:34:31,887 --> 01:34:33,940
...Balboa.

1324
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:46,109
And Bill Graham scores it 95-94...

1325
01:34:46,071 --> 01:34:51,459
...for the winner by split decision,
and still undefeated...

1326
01:34:51,409 --> 01:34:54,400
...the heavyweight champion
of the world...

1327
01:34:54,446 --> 01:35:00,392
...Mason "The Line" Dixon!

1328
01:35:02,555 --> 01:35:05,676
<i>Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!</i>

1330
01:35:57,217 --> 01:36:00,314
You know, I couldn't have
done nothing without you.

1331
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:05,326
Yo, Adrian, we did it.

1332
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,839
We did it.
